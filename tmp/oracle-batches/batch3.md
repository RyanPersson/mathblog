# Step 3: Create and Link Knowls

## Your Task

Create knowl markdown files **with cross-links already included**. You will receive:
1. The **full slug manifest** — all knowl slugs that will exist
2. Your **assigned batch** — the specific knowls you must create

Create each knowl in your batch with complete content and all relevant cross-links to other knowls in the manifest.

## Output Format

For each item, produce a complete knowl:

~~~markdown
**`[slug].md`**
```markdown
---
title: "[Display Name]"
description: "[One-line plain-text description]"
---

[Content with {{</* knowl */>}} links already included]
```
~~~

## Content Structure

### For Axioms
```markdown
---
title: "[Name]"
description: "[Plain-text one-liner]"
---

The **[name]** [state the axiom(s) using LaTeX notation].

[1-2 sentences on the role of this axiom, with links to related concepts]
```

### For Theorems
```markdown
---
title: "[Name]"
description: "[Plain-text one-liner]"
---

**[Name]**: [Precise statement of the result using LaTeX notation]

[1-3 sentences of context with {{</* knowl */>}} links to key concepts]

**Proof sketch** *(optional, include for major theorems)*:
[2-4 sentences outlining the key idea of the proof]
```

### For Lemmas
```markdown
---
title: "[Name]"
description: "[Plain-text one-liner]"
---

**[Name]**: [Precise statement]

[1-2 sentences of context with {{</* knowl */>}} links]
```

## Linking Syntax

Use the Hugo knowl shortcode:
```
{{</* knowl id="[slug]" text="[display text]" */>}}
```

Where `[slug]` is the filename without `.md` (e.g., `ring`, `ideal`).

**Link a term when:**
- It appears in prose/context sections
- It is a key concept that benefits from expansion

**Do NOT link:**
- Terms inside LaTeX math environments (`$...$` or `$$...$$`)
- The term being defined in its own definition
- Every occurrence—link only the **first meaningful occurrence**

## Level

This is 500-level (graduate) ring theory. Use full rigor appropriate for a first graduate algebra course (e.g., Dummit & Foote, Lang).

## Verification

Before submitting, verify:
- [ ] No shortcodes appear inside `$...$` or `$$...$$` math blocks
- [ ] No term is linked more than once per knowl
- [ ] Every slug in your shortcodes appears in the manifest
- [ ] The term being defined is NOT linked to itself

After producing all 30 knowls, output: `Generated 30 knowls with links.`
