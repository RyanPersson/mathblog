## Column Definitions

- **Files**: Total .md files in section
- **Knowl Refs**: Total `{{< knowl ... >}}` shortcode usages across all files (a single file can reference many knowls)
- **Proof Sketch**: Files containing "proof sketch" (intentionally kept in convex-analysis only)
- **`={{<`**: Instances of `={{< knowl` pattern (knowl inside LaTeX equation) - **FIXED**
- **`\in {{<`**: Instances of `\in {{< knowl` pattern (knowl inside LaTeX) - **FIXED**
- **Related**: Files with "## Related" or "Related knowls" sections
- **Related Notions**: Files containing "related notions" phrase (workaround for Related sections)
- **Sub-bullets**: Categorized sub-bullets like "Ideals:", "Topology:"
- **Has "definition"**: Files containing the word "definition" (may need consistency review)

## Key Observations

1. **Proof Sketch**: Removed from all sections except convex-analysis (58 files kept intentionally - will add subknowls for actual proofs later)

2. **Knowl-in-LaTeX issues**: All 14 instances fixed - knowls moved to prose, plain LaTeX in equations

3. **"definition" keyword**: fiber-bundles has 126 files with "definition" - likely needs consistency review per `docs/needs-review.md`

4. **Related/Related Notions**: The antipattern is **low-information vague lists** of related concepts. Files that construct explicit, meaningful relationships are acceptable. Remaining instances (functor.md, isomorphism-category.md, convex-lecture-notes.md) are fine - removed yoneda-lemma.md's "Related knowls" section.

5. **Remaining issues**:
   - Sub-bullets: 2 in analysis, 2 in langlands-letter
