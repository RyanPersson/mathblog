description: "The axioms for a total order compatible with addition and multiplication"

The **order axioms** for $\mathbb{R}$ assert that there is a {{< knowl id="total-order-linear-order" text="total order" >}} $\le$ such that:
- (Trichotomy) for all $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, exactly one of $a<b$, $a=b$, $a>b$ holds,
- (Transitivity) $a\le b$ and $b\le c$ imply $a\le c$,
- (Compatibility with addition) if $a\le b$ then $a+c\le b+c$ for all $c$,
- (Compatibility with multiplication) if $0\le a$ and $0\le b$ then $0\le ab$.

Together with the {{< knowl id="field-axioms" text="field axioms" >}}, these make $\mathbb{R}$ an **ordered field**, enabling inequalities, monotonicity arguments, and notions like boundedness and {{< knowl id="supremum" text="supremum" >}}.
