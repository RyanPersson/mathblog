Let $U\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ be {{< knowl id="open-set" text="open" >}} and let $f:U\to\mathbb{R}^n$ be {{< knowl id="class-ck-map" text="$C^1$" >}}. Suppose $a\in U$ and $\det Df(a)\neq 0$.

**Corollary**: There exist open {{< knowl id="neighborhood" text="neighborhoods" >}} $U_0$ of $a$ and $V_0$ of $f(a)$ such that
$
f:U_0\to V_0
$
is a $C^1$ {{< knowl id="diffeomorphism" text="diffeomorphism" >}} ({{< knowl id="bijective-function" text="bijective" >}}, $C^1$, with $C^1$ inverse).

**Connection to parent theorem**:
This is the {{< knowl id="inverse-function-theorem-rk" text="inverse function theorem" >}}, often summarized as "$f$ is a local diffeomorphism at $a$ when $\det Df(a)\neq 0$."
