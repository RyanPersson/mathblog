**Corollary**: Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}} and let $f_n:X\to\mathbb{R}$ be {{< knowl id="continuity-on-a-set" text="continuous" >}} for all $n$. If $f_n\to f$ {{< knowl id="uniform-convergence-of-a-sequence-of-functions" text="uniformly" >}} on $X$, then $f$ is continuous on $X$.

**Connection to parent theorem**:
This is exactly the {{< knowl id="uniform-limit-theorem" text="uniform limit theorem" >}} for continuity, often restated as a corollary once the theorem has been proved.
