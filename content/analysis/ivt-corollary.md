**Corollary (Intermediate Value Theorem)**: Let $I\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ be an {{< knowl id="interval" text="interval" >}} and let $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$ be {{< knowl id="continuity-on-a-set" text="continuous" >}}. If $a,b\in I$ and $y$ lies between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there exists $c$ between $a$ and $b$ such that
$
f(c)=y.
$

**Connection to parent theorem**:
This is the {{< knowl id="intermediate-value-theorem" text="intermediate value theorem" >}}, which follows from {{< knowl id="connected-set" text="connectedness" >}} of intervals and the fact that {{< knowl id="continuous-image-of-connected-set-is-connected" text="continuous images of connected sets are connected" >}} subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, hence intervals.
