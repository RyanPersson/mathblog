description: "In a metric space, unions of open sets are open and finite intersections of open sets are open"

**Open sets form a topology**: Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}}. Then:
- $\varnothing$ and $X$ are {{< knowl id="open-set" text="open" >}};
- arbitrary unions of open sets are open: if $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}$ are open, then $\bigcup_{\alpha\in A} U_\alpha$ is open;
- finite intersections of open sets are open: if $U_1,\dots,U_n$ are open, then $\bigcap_{j=1}^n U_j$ is open.

These closure properties justify treating "open sets" as the primitive objects defining the topological structure induced by a {{< knowl id="metric" text="metric" >}}.

**Proof sketch** *(optional)*:
Use the $\varepsilon$-ball definition: for unions pick the ball guaranteed by the open set containing the point; for intersections use the minimum of the radii from each open set.
