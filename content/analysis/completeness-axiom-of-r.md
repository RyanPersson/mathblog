The **completeness axiom** (least upper bound property) for $\mathbb{R}$ states:

If $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and {{< knowl id="bounded-above" text="bounded above" >}}, then $E$ has a {{< knowl id="supremum" text="least upper bound" >}} in $\mathbb{R}$; that is, there exists $s\in\mathbb{R}$ such that
- $x\le s$ for all $x\in E$ (so $s$ is an upper bound), and
- if $u$ is any upper bound of $E$, then $s\le u$ (so $s$ is the least upper bound),
and we write $s=\sup E$.

Completeness is the crucial axiom separating $\mathbb{R}$ from $\mathbb{Q}$ and is the source of many convergence and compactness results in real analysis.
