**Greatest Lower Bound Theorem**: If $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and {{< knowl id="bounded-below" text="bounded below" >}}, then $\inf E$ exists in $\mathbb{R}$.

This is the "lower" counterpart to the {{< knowl id="least-upper-bound-theorem" text="least upper bound theorem" >}} and follows immediately by applying the {{< knowl id="supremum" text="supremum" >}} property to $-E=\{-x:x\in E\}$.

**Proof sketch** *(optional)*:
If $E$ is bounded below, then $-E$ is bounded above. Let $s=\sup(-E)$. Then $-s$ is the greatest lower bound of $E$, i.e., $\inf E=-s$.
