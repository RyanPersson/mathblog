**Concept A** is a fundamental notion that is best understood in terms of {{< knowl id="concept-b" text="Concept B" >}}.

In fact, many mathematicians consider A to be the "dual" of B, though this relationship is subtle and requires understanding {{< knowl id="concept-c" text="Concept C" >}} as well.
