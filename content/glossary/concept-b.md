description: "A test concept that references Concept C"

**Concept B** emerges naturally when studying {{< knowl id="concept-c" text="Concept C" >}}.

The connection between B and {{< knowl id="concept-a" text="Concept A" >}} was first noticed by Euler in 1736, though he lacked the modern framework to make it precise.
