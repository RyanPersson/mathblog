**Concept C** completes the triad by providing a bridge back to {{< knowl id="concept-a" text="Concept A" >}}.

Without C, the relationship between {{< knowl id="concept-a" text="A" >}} and {{< knowl id="concept-b" text="B" >}} would remain mysterious. This circular dependency is a feature, not a bug.
