title: "Complete reducibility over ℂ"
description: "Every finite-dimensional complex representation of a finite group splits as a direct sum of irreducibles."

Let $G$ be a finite group and let $V$ be a finite-dimensional {{< knowl id="group-representation" text="complex representation" >}} of $G$.

## Theorem (complete reducibility over $\mathbb C$)
$V$ is {{< knowl id="completely-reducible-representation" text="completely reducible" >}}: there exist {{< knowl id="irreducible-representation" text="irreducible" >}} subrepresentations $V_1,\dots,V_m$ such that
\[
V \;\cong\; V_1\oplus\cdots\oplus V_m.
\]

Equivalently: for every {{< knowl id="subrepresentation" text="subrepresentation" >}} $W\subseteq V$, there exists a $G$-stable complement $W'\subseteq V$ with
\[
V \;=\; W \oplus W'.
\]

## Standard mechanism (unitary averaging)
Choose any Hermitian {{< knowl id="inner-product" section="shared-linear-algebra" text="inner product" >}} $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ on $V$ and average it over $G$:
\[
\langle v,w\rangle_G \;=\; \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\langle g\cdot v,\, g\cdot w\rangle.
\]
Then $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_G$ is $G$-invariant. If $W\subseteq V$ is $G$-stable, its {{< knowl id="orthogonality" section="shared-linear-algebra" text="orthogonal" >}} complement $W^\perp$ with respect to $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_G$ is also $G$-stable, giving $V=W\oplus W^\perp$.

This is a complex-analytic presentation of {{< knowl id="maschkes-theorem" text="Maschke's theorem" >}}.

## Examples

1. **Permutation representation of $S_3$ on $\mathbb C^3$.**  
   Let $S_3$ act by permuting coordinates of $V=\mathbb C^3$. The line
   \[
   U=\operatorname{span}\{(1,1,1)\}
   \]
   is $S_3$-stable (it is the trivial representation). The subspace
   \[
   W=\{(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in\mathbb C^3 : x_1+x_2+x_3=0\}
   \]
   is also $S_3$-stable and $V=U\oplus W$. Moreover, $W$ is the $2$-dimensional irreducible (standard) representation.

2. **Any representation of a cyclic group $C_n$.**  
   If $C_n=\langle g\rangle$ and $\rho(g)^n=I$, then the minimal polynomial of $\rho(g)$ divides $x^n-1$, which has distinct roots over $\mathbb C$. Hence $\rho(g)$ is diagonalizable, and $V$ decomposes as a direct sum of eigenspaces. Each eigenspace is a $1$-dimensional subrepresentation on which $g$ acts by an $n$th root of unity (a character of $C_n$).

3. **The swap representation of $C_2$ on $\mathbb C^2$.**  
   Let $C_2=\{1,s\}$ act on $V=\mathbb C^2$ by $s(x,y)=(y,x)$. Then
   \[
   V = \operatorname{span}\{(1,1)\}\;\oplus\;\operatorname{span}\{(1,-1)\}.
   \]
   The first summand is the trivial representation; the second is the sign representation (where $s$ acts as $-1$).
