## Definition (integral over a ring)
Let \(R \subseteq S\) be a ring extension (typically commutative, with \(1\)). An element \(x\in S\) is **integral over \(R\)** if there exists a monic polynomial
\[
f(t)=t^n + a_{n-1}t^{n-1}+\cdots + a_1 t + a_0 \in R[t]
\]
such that \(f(x)=0\).

Equivalently, \(x\) is integral over \(R\) iff the subring \(R[x]\subseteq S\) is a finitely generated \(R\)-{{< knowl id="module" section="algebra-modules" text="module" >}} (in fact generated by \(1,x,\dots,x^{n-1}\)).

An extension \(R\subseteq S\) is called {{< knowl id="integral-extension" text="integral" >}} if **every** element of \(S\) is integral over \(R\).

## Examples
1. **Gaussian integers.**  
   In \(\mathbb Z \subset \mathbb Z[i]\), the element \(i\) is integral over \(\mathbb Z\) since it satisfies the monic polynomial
   \[
   t^2+1=0.
   \]

2. **Adjoining a square root.**  
   In \(\mathbb Z \subset \mathbb Z[\sqrt{2}]\), the element \(\sqrt{2}\) is integral over \(\mathbb Z\) since it satisfies
   \[
   t^2-2=0.
   \]

3. **A non-example: \(1/2\) over \(\mathbb Z\).**  
   The element \(1/2\in \mathbb Q\) is **not** integral over \(\mathbb Z\).  
   Indeed, if \((1/2)\) satisfied a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, multiplying by a suitable power of \(2\) would force an integer divisibility contradiction (equivalently: the only rationals integral over \(\mathbb Z\) are the integers).
