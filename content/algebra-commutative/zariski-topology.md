title: "Zariski topology"
description: "The natural topology on Spec(R) whose closed sets are defined by vanishing of ideals."

Let $R$ be a {{< knowl id="commutative-ring" section="algebra-rings" text="commutative ring" >}}, and consider its {{< knowl id="prime-spectrum" text="prime spectrum \operatorname{Spec}(R)" >}}.

For an ideal $I\subseteq R$, define
\[
V(I) := \{\mathfrak p \in \operatorname{Spec}(R)\mid I\subseteq \mathfrak p\}.
\]
The **Zariski topology** on $\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ is the topology for which the sets $V(I)$ are precisely the closed subsets, i.e. a subset $Z\subseteq \operatorname{Spec}(R)$ is closed if and only if $Z=V(I)$ for some ideal $I$.

Equivalently, the sets
\[
D(f):=\operatorname{Spec}(R)\setminus V((f))=\{\mathfrak p\in\operatorname{Spec}(R)\mid f\notin\mathfrak p\}
\quad (f\in R)
\]
form a basis of open sets. These basic opens interact tightly with {{< knowl id="localization-ring" text="localization" >}}: the correspondence of prime ideals under localization yields a natural homeomorphism between $D(f)$ and the spectrum of the localized ring $R_f$ (compare {{< knowl id="localization-prime-correspondence" text="the prime correspondence for localization" >}} and {{< knowl id="localization-inverts-multiplicative-set" text="the fact that localization inverts a multiplicative set" >}}).

A useful geometric intuition is: $V(I)$ consists of those primes where all elements of $I$ “vanish,” while $D(f)$ consists of those primes where $f$ “does not vanish.”

### Examples

1. **A field.**  
   If $k$ is a {{< knowl id="field" section="algebra-rings" text="field" >}}, then $\operatorname{Spec}(k)=\{(0)\}$. The only closed sets are $\emptyset$ and $\{(0)\}$, so the Zariski topology is the trivial one-point topology.

2. **The integers.**  
   In $\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, the closed set $V((n))$ consists of all prime ideals containing $n$, i.e. the points $(p)$ where $p$ divides $n$. Thus the basic open $D(n)$ is the set of primes not dividing $n$, together with the generic point $(0)$.

3. **A principal ideal domain: $\operatorname{Spec}(k[x])$.**  
   Let $k$ be a field and $R=k[x]$. If $f\neq 0$, then $V((f))$ is a finite set: it consists of the prime ideals generated by the irreducible factors of $f$. Consequently, the complements $D(f)$ are cofinite open subsets (plus the generic point behavior), illustrating why Zariski opens are typically “large.”
