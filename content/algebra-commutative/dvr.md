Let \(R\) be a commutative ring.

## Definition
A **discrete valuation ring (DVR)** is an {{< knowl id="local-ring" text="local ring" >}} \((R,\mathfrak m)\) such that:
- \(R\) is an {{< knowl id="integral-domain" section="algebra-rings" text="integral domain" >}},
- \(R\) is {{< knowl id="noetherian-ring" text="Noetherian" >}},
- the maximal ideal \(\mathfrak m\) is principal: \(\mathfrak m=(\pi)\) for some \(\pi\in R\),
- and \(\dim R = 1\) ({{< knowl id="krull-dimension" text="Krull dimension" >}}).

The generator \(\pi\) is called a **uniformizer**. In a DVR, every nonzero ideal has the form \((\pi^n)\) for a unique \(n\ge 0\).

Equivalent characterizations (useful in practice):
- A DVR is exactly a {{< knowl id="pid" section="algebra-rings" text="PID" >}} with a unique nonzero prime ideal.
- A DVR is exactly a localization {{< knowl id="localization-at-prime" text="at a nonzero prime" >}} of a {{< knowl id="dedekind-domain" text="Dedekind domain" >}}.

The residue field is \(R/\mathfrak m\) (see {{< knowl id="residue-field" text="residue field" >}}).

## Examples
1. **\(p\)-local integers.**  
   \(\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}\) (localizing \(\mathbb{Z}\) at the prime \((p)\)) is a DVR with uniformizer \(p\).

2. **Formal power series.**  
   For a field \(k\), the ring \(k[[t]]\) is a DVR with uniformizer \(t\); its maximal ideal is \((t)\).

3. **A localized polynomial ring.**  
   \(k[x]_{(x)}\) is a DVR with uniformizer \(x\) (it is local with maximal ideal generated by \(x\)).
