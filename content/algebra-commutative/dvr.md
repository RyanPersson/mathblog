A **discrete valuation ring (DVR)** is the basic local building block of dimension-one commutative algebra.

## Definition
A DVR is a local ring $(R,\mathfrak m)$ (see {{< knowl id="local-ring" text="local ring" >}} and {{< knowl id="maximal-ideal-local-ring" text="its maximal ideal" >}}) such that:
- $R$ is a domain,
- $R$ is {{< knowl id="noetherian-ring" text="Noetherian" >}},
- the maximal ideal $\mathfrak m$ is principal: $\mathfrak m=(\pi)$ for some $\pi\in \mathfrak m$,
- and $R$ has {{< knowl id="krull-dimension" text="Krull dimension" >}} $1$.

Any generator $\pi$ of $\mathfrak m$ is called a **uniformizer**.

## Equivalent characterizations
For a local domain $(R,\mathfrak m)$ that is not a field, the following are equivalent:
1. $R$ is a DVR.
2. $R$ is a principal ideal domain and has a unique nonzero prime ideal (namely $\mathfrak m$).
3. There exists $\pi\in \mathfrak m$ such that every nonzero ideal of $R$ is of the form $(\pi^n)$ for a unique $n\ge 0$.

In particular, in a DVR the ideals form a totally ordered chain:
\[
R \supset (\pi) \supset (\pi^2) \supset (\pi^3) \supset \cdots.
\]

DVRs arise naturally from {{< knowl id="dedekind-domain" text="Dedekind domains" >}}: if $R$ is Dedekind and $\mathfrak p\neq (0)$ is prime, then $R_\mathfrak p$ is a DVR (via {{< knowl id="localization-at-prime" text="localization at $\mathfrak p$" >}}).

## Examples
1. **Formal power series.**  
   If $k$ is a {{< knowl id="field" section="algebra-rings" text="field" >}}, then $k[[t]]$ is a DVR with maximal ideal $(t)$ and uniformizer $t$.

2. **Localization of a PID at a prime.**  
   $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ is a DVR: it is local with maximal ideal generated by $p$, and every ideal is $(p^n)$.

3. **A polynomial example.**  
   $k[t]_{(t)}$ (localization of $k[t]$ at the prime $(t)$) is a DVR with uniformizer $t$.

## A useful structural fact
In a DVR, the valuation “order of vanishing” is encoded by powers of $\pi$: for $0\ne x\in \mathrm{Frac}(R)$, one can write $x=\pi^n u$ with $u\in R^\times$ and $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, uniquely.
