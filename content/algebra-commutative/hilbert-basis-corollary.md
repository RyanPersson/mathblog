The basic finiteness engine in commutative algebra is that “Noetherian stays Noetherian after adjoining finitely many indeterminates.” This is often invoked as a corollary whenever one wants to know that ideals in polynomial rings are finitely generated.

## Corollary (Hilbert basis)
Let \(R\) be a {{< knowl id="noetherian-ring" text="Noetherian ring" >}}. Then for every \(n \ge 1\), the polynomial ring \(R[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) is Noetherian.

Consequently:
- Every ideal of \(R[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) is finitely generated.
- Every quotient \(R[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I\) is Noetherian (so coordinate rings of affine varieties over a field inherit Noetherianity).
- In particular, if \(k\) is a {{< knowl id="field" section="algebra-rings" text="field" >}}, then \(k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) is Noetherian.

## Examples
1. **Polynomial rings over a field.**  
   For a field \(k\), the ring \(k[x,y,z]\) is Noetherian. For instance, the ideal \((x^2+yz,\; y^3-z)\) is automatically finitely generated (indeed, generated by the displayed two elements).

2. **Polynomial rings over the integers.**  
   Since \(\mathbb Z\) is Noetherian, \(\mathbb Z[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) is Noetherian. In particular, ideals like \((2,\; x^2,\; xy) \subset \mathbb Z[x,y]\) are finitely generated (here by three explicit generators).

3. **Coordinate rings are Noetherian.**  
   Over a field \(k\), the quotient ring \(k[x,y]/(x^2+y^2-1)\) is Noetherian, because it is a quotient of the Noetherian ring \(k[x,y]\).
