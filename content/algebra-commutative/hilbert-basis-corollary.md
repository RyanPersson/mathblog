**Corollary (Hilbert basis, finitely generated algebras are Noetherian).**  
Let \(R\) be a {{< knowl id="noetherian-ring" text="Noetherian ring" >}} and let \(A\) be a commutative \(R\)-algebra generated by finitely many elements over \(R\), i.e. \(A = R[a_1,\dots,a_n]\). Then \(A\) is Noetherian.

Equivalently: if \(A\) is a quotient of a polynomial ring
\[
A \;\cong\; R[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I
\]
for some ideal \(I\), then \(A\) is Noetherian.

*Idea:* by the {{< knowl id="hilbert-basis-theorem" section="algebra-rings" text="Hilbert basis theorem" >}}, \(R[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) is Noetherian; and any {{< knowl id="quotient-ring" section="algebra-rings" text="quotient ring" >}} of a Noetherian ring is Noetherian.

## Examples

1. **Polynomial rings over a field.**  
   If \(k\) is a field, then \(k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) is Noetherian. Concretely, every ideal of \(k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) is finitely generated.

2. **A finitely generated \(\mathbb{Z}\)-algebra.**  
   \(A=\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2-2)\) is Noetherian (it is a quotient of the Noetherian ring \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\)).

3. **Coordinate rings of affine algebraic sets.**  
   Over a field \(k\), rings like
   \[
   k[x,y]/(y^2-x^3-x)
   \quad\text{or}\quad
   k[x,y,z]/(xz-y^2)
   \]
   are Noetherian: they are quotients of the Noetherian ring \(k[x,y]\) or \(k[x,y,z]\).
