title: "Prime spectrum"
description: "The set Spec(R) of prime ideals of a commutative ring, naturally equipped with the Zariski topology."

Let $R$ be a {{< knowl id="commutative-ring" section="algebra-rings" text="commutative ring" >}}. A **prime ideal** of $R$ is a proper ideal $\mathfrak p\subsetneq R$ such that whenever $ab\in\mathfrak p$ (with $a,b\in R$), then $a\in\mathfrak p$ or $b\in\mathfrak p$.

The **prime spectrum** of $R$ is the set
\[
\operatorname{Spec}(R) := \{\mathfrak p \subset R \mid \mathfrak p \text{ is a prime ideal}\}.
\]
An element $\mathfrak p\in \operatorname{Spec}(R)$ is called a **point** of $\operatorname{Spec}(R)$.

In commutative algebra one usually studies $\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ together with the {{< knowl id="zariski-topology" text="Zariski topology" >}}; this turns $\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ into a topological space whose basic opens are closely related to {{< knowl id="localization-ring" text="localizations" >}}. For a point $\mathfrak p\in\operatorname{Spec}(R)$, the associated local data are the {{< knowl id="localization-at-prime" text="localization $R_{\mathfrak p}$" >}} and its {{< knowl id="residue-field" text="residue field $\kappa(\mathfrak p)$" >}}.

### Examples

1. **A field has a one-point spectrum.**  
   If $k$ is a {{< knowl id="field" section="algebra-rings" text="field" >}}, the only prime ideal is $(0)$, so $\operatorname{Spec}(k)=\{(0)\}$.

2. **The spectrum of the integers.**  
   In $R=\mathbb{Z}$, the prime ideals are $(0)$ and $(p)$ for primes $p$. Thus
   \[
   \operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})=\{(0)\}\ \cup\ \{(p)\mid p\ \text{prime}\}.
   \]
   Under the {{< knowl id="zariski-topology" text="Zariski topology" >}}, the point $(0)$ is a generic point whose closure is all of $\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$.

3. **The spectrum of a polynomial ring in one variable.**  
   Let $k$ be a field and $R=k[x]$. Then $(0)$ is prime, and every nonzero prime ideal is generated by an irreducible polynomial. So
   \[
   \operatorname{Spec}(k[x])=\{(0)\}\ \cup\ \{(f)\mid f\in k[x]\ \text{irreducible}\}.
   \]
   If $k$ is algebraically closed, the maximal ideals are precisely $(x-a)$, and {{< knowl id="maximal-spectrum" text="$\operatorname{MaxSpec}(k[x])$" >}} can be identified with the affine line over $k$.
