title: "Local ring"
description: "A commutative ring with exactly one maximal ideal."
---

A {{< knowl id="commutative-ring" section="algebra-rings" text="commutative ring" >}} $R$ is a **local ring** if it has a unique maximal ideal. One often records this ideal and writes $(R,\mathfrak m)$, where $\mathfrak m$ is the unique maximal ideal.

The unique maximal ideal of a local ring is closely tied to units; see {{< knowl id="maximal-ideal-local-ring" text="maximal ideal of a local ring" >}}. The quotient $R/\mathfrak m$ is the {{< knowl id="residue-field" text="residue field" >}} of $R$.

### Equivalent characterizations
For a commutative ring $R$, the following are equivalent:

1. $R$ is local (i.e. it has a unique maximal ideal).
2. The set of nonunits in $R$ is an ideal; this ideal is then the unique maximal ideal.
3. Whenever $a+b=1$ in $R$, at least one of $a$ or $b$ is a unit.

Local rings arise systematically from localization: if $\mathfrak p$ is a prime ideal of $R$, then {{< knowl id="localization-at-prime" text="localizing at the prime" >}} produces the local ring $R_{\mathfrak p}$.

Many foundational results in commutative algebra are naturally stated for local rings; for instance, {{< knowl id="nakayama-lemma" text="Nakayama's lemma" >}} is formulated for finitely generated modules over a local ring.

### Examples

1. **Fields.** Any {{< knowl id="field" section="algebra-rings" text="field" >}} $k$ is local: its only maximal ideal is $(0)$.

2. **Localizing $\mathbb Z$ at a prime.** For a prime number $p$, the ring $\mathbb Z_{(p)}$ from {{< knowl id="localization-at-prime" text="localization at (p)" >}} is local, with maximal ideal $p\mathbb Z_{(p)}$.

3. **Localizing a polynomial ring at a maximal ideal.** If $k$ is a field, then $k[x]_{(x)}$ is local with maximal ideal generated by $x$. More generally, $k[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ is local with maximal ideal $(x,y)$.
