title: "Localization preserves Noetherianity"
description: "If a ring is Noetherian, then any localization (in particular at a prime) is Noetherian."

Localization is built from a {{< knowl id="multiplicative-set" text="multiplicative set" >}} and formally inverts its elements (see {{< knowl id="localization-ring" text="localization" >}}). A fundamental finiteness fact is that Noetherianity survives this process; compare {{< knowl id="localization-noetherian" text="localization preserves Noetherianity" >}}.

## Corollary (Noetherianity localizes)
Let \(R\) be a {{< knowl id="noetherian-ring" text="Noetherian ring" >}} and let \(S \subset R\) be a {{< knowl id="multiplicative-set" text="multiplicative set" >}}. Then the localization \(S^{-1}R\) is Noetherian.

In particular, for any prime ideal \(\mathfrak p\), the {{< knowl id="localization-at-prime" text="localization at \(\mathfrak p\)" >}} is Noetherian:
\(R_{\mathfrak p}\) is a Noetherian {{< knowl id="local-ring" text="local ring" >}}. Likewise, for any maximal ideal \(\mathfrak m\), \(R_{\mathfrak m}\) is a Noetherian local ring in the sense of {{< knowl id="maximal-ideal-local-ring" text="local ring with maximal ideal" >}}.

## Examples
1. **Localizing the integers.**  
   \(\mathbb Z\) is Noetherian, so for any prime \(p\) the localization \(\mathbb Z_{(p)}\) is Noetherian. Concretely, \(\mathbb Z_{(p)}\) consists of fractions \(a/b\) with \(p\nmid b\), and its unique maximal ideal is generated by \(p\).

2. **Inverting a polynomial.**  
   If \(R=k[x,y]\) with \(k\) a field, then \(R\) is Noetherian by {{< knowl id="hilbert-basis-corollary" text="Hilbert basis" >}}. Localizing at the multiplicative set \(\{1,x,x^2,\dots\}\) gives \(k[x,y]_x\), which is again Noetherian.

3. **Localization can simplify quotients.**  
   In \(A = k[x,y]/(xy)\), localize at powers of \(x\). Since \(x\) becomes invertible in \(A_x\), the relation \(xy=0\) forces \(y=0\) in the localization, so \(A_x \cong k[x,x^{-1}]\), a Noetherian ring.
