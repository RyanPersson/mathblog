## Definition (maximal spectrum)
Let \(R\) be a {{< knowl id="commutative-ring" section="algebra-rings" text="commutative ring" >}} (with \(1\)). The **maximal spectrum** of \(R\) is
\[
\operatorname{MaxSpec}(R)\;:=\;\{\ \mathfrak m \subset R \mid \mathfrak m \text{ is a } {{< knowl id="maximal-ideal" section="algebra-rings" text="maximal ideal" >}} \ \}.
\]
Since every maximal ideal is prime, there is a natural inclusion
\[
\operatorname{MaxSpec}(R)\ \subseteq\ \operatorname{Spec}(R)={{< knowl id="prime-spectrum" text="Spec(R)" >}}.
\]

The **Zariski topology** on \(\operatorname{MaxSpec}(R)\) is the subspace topology induced from {{< knowl id="zariski-topology" text="the Zariski topology on Spec(R)" >}}.

Equivalently, closed sets in \(\operatorname{MaxSpec}(R)\) are of the form
\[
V(I)\cap \operatorname{MaxSpec}(R)
\]
for ideals \(I\subset R\).

## Examples
1. **A field.**  
   If \(k\) is a field, then \(\operatorname{MaxSpec}(k)=\{(0)\}\).

2. **The integers.**  
   \[
   \operatorname{MaxSpec}(\mathbb Z)=\{(p)\mid p \text{ prime}\},
   \]
   since the maximal ideals of \(\mathbb Z\) are exactly the principal ideals generated by primes.

3. **Affine line over an algebraically closed field.**  
   If \(k\) is algebraically closed, then maximal ideals of \(k[x]\) are exactly \((x-a)\) for \(a\in k\). Hence
   \[
   \operatorname{MaxSpec}(k[x]) \cong k
   \]
   as sets (and the Zariski closed sets correspond to finite subsets and the whole set).
