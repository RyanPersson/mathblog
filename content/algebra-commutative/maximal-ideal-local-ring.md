title: "Maximal ideal of a local ring"
description: "In a local ring, the unique maximal ideal is exactly the set of nonunits."

Let $R$ be a {{< knowl id="commutative-ring" section="algebra-rings" text="commutative ring" >}}. Write $R^\times$ for the group of units of $R$, and let
\[
\mathfrak m := R\setminus R^\times
\]
be the set of nonunits.

### Theorem (nonunits form the unique maximal ideal)
The following are equivalent:

1. $R$ is a {{< knowl id="local-ring" text="local ring" >}}.
2. The set $\mathfrak m$ of nonunits is an ideal of $R$.

When these conditions hold, $\mathfrak m$ is the **unique maximal ideal** of $R$. Equivalently, an element $x\in R$ is a unit if and only if $x\notin\mathfrak m$.

In the important special case $R_{\mathfrak p}$ from {{< knowl id="localization-at-prime" text="localization at a prime" >}}, the unique maximal ideal is $\mathfrak pR_{\mathfrak p}$, and the associated {{< knowl id="residue-field" text="residue field" >}} is $R_{\mathfrak p}/\mathfrak pR_{\mathfrak p}$.

This “units vs. maximal ideal” dichotomy is exactly what makes local arguments work; for instance, it is the setup needed in {{< knowl id="nakayama-lemma" text="Nakayama's lemma" >}}.

### Examples

1. **$\mathbb Z_{(p)}$.** In $R=\mathbb Z_{(p)}$, a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ (with $p\nmid b$) is a unit iff $p\nmid a$. Thus the nonunits are precisely those with numerator divisible by $p$, i.e. the maximal ideal is $p\mathbb Z_{(p)}$.

2. **$k[x]_{(x)}$.** In $R=k[x]_{(x)}$, the units are exactly fractions $\frac{f}{g}$ with $f(0)\neq 0$ (and $g(0)\neq 0$ by definition of the localization). Hence the nonunits are those with $f(0)=0$, i.e. the maximal ideal is generated by $x$.

3. **A field.** In a field $k$, the only nonunit is $0$, so $\mathfrak m=(0)$ is the unique maximal ideal.
