title: "Localization at a prime ideal"
description: "The ring R_p obtained by inverting all elements outside a prime ideal p."
---

Let $R$ be a {{< knowl id="commutative-ring" section="algebra-rings" text="commutative ring" >}} and let $\mathfrak p\subset R$ be a prime ideal. The complement
\[
S=R\setminus \mathfrak p
\]
is a {{< knowl id="multiplicative-set" text="multiplicative set" >}}. The **localization of $R$ at $\mathfrak p$** is the ring
\[
R_{\mathfrak p} := S^{-1}R,
\]
i.e. the {{< knowl id="localization-ring" text="localization of a ring" >}} obtained by inverting exactly the elements not lying in $\mathfrak p$.

### Basic properties
- Every element $s\in R\setminus\mathfrak p$ maps to a unit in $R_{\mathfrak p}$.
- The ring $R_{\mathfrak p}$ is a {{< knowl id="local-ring" text="local ring" >}}. Its unique maximal ideal is
  \[
  \mathfrak pR_{\mathfrak p}=\left\{\frac{r}{s}: r\in\mathfrak p,\ s\notin\mathfrak p\right\}.
  \]
  This description is part of the general phenomenon summarized in {{< knowl id="localization-prime-correspondence" text="prime correspondence under localization" >}}.
- The quotient $R_{\mathfrak p}/\mathfrak pR_{\mathfrak p}$ is the {{< knowl id="residue-field" text="residue field" >}} at $\mathfrak p$.

Geometrically, points of {{< knowl id="prime-spectrum" text="Spec(R)" >}} are prime ideals, and $R_{\mathfrak p}$ is the algebraic “stalk” of $R$ at the point $\mathfrak p$.

### Examples

1. **Integers localized at $(p)$.** For $R=\mathbb Z$ and $\mathfrak p=(p)$ with $p$ prime,
   \[
   \mathbb Z_{(p)}=\left\{\frac{a}{b}\in\mathbb Q:\ p\nmid b\right\}.
   \]
   The maximal ideal is $p\mathbb Z_{(p)}$, and the residue field is $\mathbb F_p$.

2. **Local ring at the origin on the line.** For $R=k[x]$ and $\mathfrak p=(x)$,
   \[
   k[x]_{(x)}=\left\{\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}:\ g(0)\neq 0\right\}.
   \]
   Its maximal ideal is generated by $x$, and the residue field is naturally isomorphic to $k$.

3. **Local ring at the origin in the plane.** For $R=k[x,y]$ and $\mathfrak p=(x,y)$,
   \[
   k[x,y]_{(x,y)}
   \]
   consists of fractions $\frac{f}{g}$ with $g(0,0)\neq 0$. The maximal ideal is $(x,y)k[x,y]_{(x,y)}$, and the residue field is $k$.
