title: "Artinian ring"
description: "A ring satisfying the descending chain condition on ideals."
---

Let \(R\) be a commutative ring.

## Definition
\(R\) is **Artinian** if it satisfies the **descending chain condition** (DCC) on {{< knowl id="ideal" section="algebra-rings" text="ideals" >}}: every chain
\[
I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq I_3 \supseteq \cdots
\]
stabilizes.

## Useful facts (commutative case)
- Every Artinian ring is {{< knowl id="noetherian-ring" text="Noetherian" >}}.
- \(\mathrm{Spec}(R)\) is finite and every {{< knowl id="prime-ideal" section="algebra-rings" text="prime ideal" >}} is {{< knowl id="maximal-ideal" section="algebra-rings" text="maximal" >}}; equivalently the {{< knowl id="krull-dimension" text="Krull dimension" >}} is \(0\).
- Artinian rings often split as finite products via {{< knowl id="chinese-remainder-theorem" section="algebra-rings" text="Chinese remainder" >}} ideas, especially when maximal ideals are comaximal.

## Examples
1. **Fields.**  
   A field has only two ideals \((0)\) and \((1)\), so it is Artinian.

2. **\(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\).**  
   The ring \(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\) is Artinian (in fact finite), hence also Noetherian.

3. **A local Artinian example.**  
   \(k[x]/(x^n)\) is Artinian and {{< knowl id="local-ring" text="local" >}} with maximal ideal generated by the class of \(x\); that class is {{< knowl id="nilpotent-element" section="algebra-rings" text="nilpotent" >}}.
