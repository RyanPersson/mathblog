### Definition
Let $J$ be the standard symplectic matrix
$$
J=\begin{pmatrix}0&I_n\\-I_n&0\end{pmatrix},
$$
so the bilinear form $\omega(u,v)=u^T J v$ on $\mathbb R^{2n}$ is nondegenerate and skew-symmetric. The **real symplectic group** is
$$
\mathrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb R)=\{A\in GL(2n,\mathbb R)\mid A^T J A = J\}.
$$
This is a closed subgroup of the {{< knowl id="general-linear-group" text="general linear group" >}}, hence a Lie subgroup by the {{< knowl id="closed-subgroup-theorem" text="closed subgroup theorem" >}}.

More generally, for any field $\mathbb F$ of characteristic $\neq 2$, one defines $\mathrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb F)$ as the group preserving a fixed nondegenerate alternating form; different choices are conjugate in $GL(2n,\mathbb F)$.

### Lie algebra
The Lie algebra of $\mathrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb R)$ is the {{< knowl id="symplectic-lie-algebra" text="symplectic Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{sp}(2n,\\mathbb R)$" >}}, obtained by differentiating the defining equation $A^TJA=J$ at the identity.

### Context
$\mathrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb R)$ is the basic symmetry group of linear symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics: it preserves the standard symplectic form and hence the canonical Poisson structure on $\mathbb R^{2n}$. In representation theory, its complexification corresponds to the simple Lie algebra of type $C_n$ (compare {{< knowl id="root-system" text="root systems" >}} and {{< knowl id="dynkin-diagram" text="Dynkin diagrams" >}}).
