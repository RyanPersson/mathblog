Let $\mathfrak g$ be a finite-dimensional {{< knowl id="lie-algebra" text="Lie algebra" >}} over a field of characteristic $0$.

**Theorem (Levi decomposition).**  
There exists a largest solvable ideal $\mathfrak r\subseteq \mathfrak g$, called the **radical** (a notion built from {{< knowl id="solvable-lie-algebra" text="solvability" >}} and ideals as in {{< knowl id="ideal-lie-algebra" text="ideal" >}}), and a semisimple subalgebra $\mathfrak s\subseteq \mathfrak g$ such that
\[
\mathfrak g \cong \mathfrak s \ltimes \mathfrak r
\]
as Lie algebras. Here $\mathfrak s$ is called a **Levi factor** and $\mathfrak r$ is the solvable radical.

Moreover, any two Levi factors are conjugate by an inner automorphism of $\mathfrak g$ (more precisely, by an automorphism arising from the exponential of an {{< knowl id="inner-derivation" text="inner derivation" >}} coming from $\mathfrak r$), so the semisimple part is essentially unique.

**Context.**  
This theorem isolates the “semisimple core” of a Lie algebra and reduces many problems to understanding semisimple algebras (see {{< knowl id="semisimple-lie-algebra" text="semisimple Lie algebras" >}}) plus solvable/nilpotent structure (compare {{< knowl id="derived-series-lie-algebra" text="derived series" >}} and {{< knowl id="nilpotent-lie-algebra" text="nilpotent Lie algebras" >}}). It is also a key input in analyzing Lie algebras arising from {{< knowl id="compact-lie-group" text="compact Lie groups" >}}.
