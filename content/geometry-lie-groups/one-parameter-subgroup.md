description: "A smooth homomorphism from (R,+) into a Lie group, generated by a Lie algebra element."

Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}} with Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$.

## Definition
A **one-parameter subgroup** of $G$ is a smooth {{< knowl id="lie-group-homomorphism" text="group homomorphism" >}}
$$
\gamma:(\Bbb R,+)\to G.
$$
Equivalently, $\gamma$ is a smooth curve satisfying $\gamma(t+s)=\gamma(t)\gamma(s)$ and $\gamma(0)=e$.

## Theorem (classification by the Lie algebra)
For each $X\in\mathfrak g$, the curve
$$
\gamma_X(t)=\exp(tX)
$$
is a one-parameter subgroup (see {{< knowl id="exponential-one-parameter-subgroup-lemma" text="the exponential–one-parameter subgroup lemma" >}}).

Conversely, if $\gamma$ is any one-parameter subgroup, then the derivative
$$
X=\gamma'(0)\in T_eG\cong \mathfrak g
$$
determines $\gamma$ uniquely by $\gamma(t)=\exp(tX)$ for all $t$.

Thus, one-parameter subgroups are in bijection with elements of $\mathfrak g$.

## Context
One-parameter subgroups are the group-theoretic shadows of constant-coefficient ODE flows on $G$; the precise relationship is expressed by {{< knowl id="one-parameter-subgroups-integral-curves" text="their interpretation as integral curves of invariant vector fields" >}}.
