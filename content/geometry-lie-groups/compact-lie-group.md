**Definition.** A {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}} $G$ is **compact** if its underlying topological space is compact.

**Core structural features.**
- Compactness implies the existence of a bi-invariant Haar measure, enabling averaging arguments throughout geometry and representation theory.
- Every compact Lie group admits a {{< knowl id="bi-invariant-metric" text="bi-invariant Riemannian metric" >}}; see {{< knowl id="compact-lie-group-bi-invariant-metric" text="bi-invariant metrics on compact Lie groups" >}}.
- Maximal tori control much of the structure: every element lies in some maximal torus, and conjugacy classes intersect a fixed maximal torus in Weyl-group orbits (see {{< knowl id="maximal-torus-theorem" text="the maximal torus theorem" >}} and {{< knowl id="weyl-group" text="the Weyl group" >}}).

**Representation-theoretic context.** Finite-dimensional continuous representations of compact Lie groups are {{< knowl id="completely-reducible-representation-lie" text="completely reducible" >}}, and the regular representation on $L^2(G)$ decomposes discretely (compare {{< knowl id="peter-weyl-theorem" text="the Peter–Weyl theorem" >}}).

For a global decomposition of compact connected groups into torus and semisimple parts, see {{< knowl id="compact-lie-group-structure" text="structure of compact Lie groups" >}}.
