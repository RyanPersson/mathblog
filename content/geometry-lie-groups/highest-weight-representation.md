description: "A representation generated by a vector annihilated by the positive root spaces."

Let $\mathfrak g$ be a complex semisimple {{< knowl id="lie-algebra" text="Lie algebra" >}} with a fixed {{< knowl id="cartan-subalgebra" text="Cartan subalgebra" >}} $\mathfrak h$ and choice of positive roots, giving a triangular decomposition
\[
\mathfrak g=\mathfrak n^-\oplus \mathfrak h\oplus \mathfrak n^+,
\]
as in the {{< knowl id="root-space-decomposition" text="root space decomposition" >}} setup.

**Definition (Highest-weight representation).**  
A $\mathfrak g$-module $V$ is a **highest-weight representation** if there exists a nonzero vector $v\in V$ such that

- $\mathfrak n^+\cdot v=0$, and  
- $v$ is a weight vector for $\mathfrak h$, say $h\cdot v=\lambda(h)v$,

and $V$ is generated by $v$ as a $\mathfrak g$-module. The weight $\lambda$ is then the {{< knowl id="highest-weight" text="highest weight" >}} of $V$.

If $V$ is finite-dimensional and irreducible (see {{< knowl id="irreducible-representation-lie-algebra" text="irreducibility" >}}), then $V$ is automatically highest-weight for any choice of positive roots, and the highest weight is uniquely determined by $V$.

**Motivation.**  
Highest-weight representations provide a “triangular” way to build modules: one starts from a single extremal vector and generates everything by applying negative root operators. This is the mechanism behind the classification in the {{< knowl id="highest-weight-theorem" text="highest-weight theorem" >}}.
