title: "Lie algebra of a subgroup lemma"
description: "A Lie subgroup has Lie algebra equal to its tangent space at the identity, viewed as a Lie subalgebra."

Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}} and let $H\subseteq G$ be a {{< knowl id="lie-subgroup" text="Lie subgroup" >}} with inclusion map $\iota:H\hookrightarrow G$.

## Lemma
The differential at the identity
$$
(d\iota)_e : \operatorname{Lie}(H)\to \operatorname{Lie}(G)
$$
is injective, and its image identifies $\operatorname{Lie}(H)$ with the subspace $T_eH\subseteq T_eG$. Under this identification, $\operatorname{Lie}(H)$ is a {{< knowl id="lie-subalgebra" text="Lie subalgebra" >}} of $\operatorname{Lie}(G)$.

Equivalently: the Lie algebra of a Lie subgroup is its tangent space at the identity, with the bracket inherited from $\operatorname{Lie}(G)$.

## Context
When $H$ is a *closed* subgroup, {{< knowl id="closed-subgroup-theorem" text="the closed subgroup theorem" >}} guarantees that $H$ is an embedded Lie subgroup, so $T_eH$ is literally a subspace of $T_eG$ in the usual embedded-submanifold sense. In that case, this lemma is the key step behind the subgroup–subalgebra bridge used in the {{< knowl id="lie-correspondence" text="Lie correspondence" >}}.
