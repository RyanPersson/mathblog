Let $\mathfrak g$ be a finite-dimensional {{< knowl id="lie-algebra" text="Lie algebra" >}} over $\Bbb R$ (or $\Bbb C$).

## Theorem (existence and uniqueness up to simply connected cover)
There exists a connected, {{< knowl id="simply-connected-lie-group" text="simply connected Lie group" >}} $G$ such that
$$
\operatorname{Lie}(G)\cong \mathfrak g
$$
as Lie algebras (via a {{< knowl id="lie-algebra-isomorphism" text="Lie algebra isomorphism" >}}).

Moreover, if $G_1$ and $G_2$ are connected simply connected Lie groups with Lie algebras isomorphic to $\mathfrak g$, then $G_1$ and $G_2$ are isomorphic as {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie groups" >}}. In other words, the simply connected integration of $\mathfrak g$ is unique up to Lie group isomorphism.

## Context
Combined with the fact that every connected Lie group has a {{< knowl id="universal-covering-group" text="universal covering group" >}} which is again a Lie group (see {{< knowl id="universal-covering-group-existence" text="existence of universal covering groups" >}}), Lie’s third theorem explains why Lie algebras control the local—and, up to discrete central quotients, the global—structure of connected Lie groups (compare {{< knowl id="simply-connected-determined-by-algebra" text="simply connected groups are determined by their Lie algebra" >}}).

It also underlies the {{< knowl id="lie-correspondence" text="Lie correspondence" >}}: Lie subalgebras integrate to connected (immersed) Lie subgroups inside a given Lie group.
