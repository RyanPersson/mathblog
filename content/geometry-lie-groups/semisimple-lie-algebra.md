A finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ (over a field of characteristic $0$) is **semisimple** if it has no nonzero solvable ideals. Equivalently, if $\mathrm{Rad}(\mathfrak g)$ denotes the solvable radical, then $\mathfrak g$ is semisimple exactly when $\mathrm{Rad}(\mathfrak g)=0$ (compare {{< knowl id="solvable-lie-algebra" text="solvable Lie algebra" >}} and {{< knowl id="ideal-lie-algebra" text="ideals" >}}).

A fundamental characterization is:

- **Cartan’s criterion / Killing form test:** in characteristic $0$, $\mathfrak g$ is semisimple if and only if its {{< knowl id="killing-form" text="Killing form" >}} is nondegenerate (see {{< knowl id="killing-form-nondegenerate-iff-semisimple" text="Killing form nondegenerate iff semisimple" >}}, and compare {{< knowl id="cartans-criterion-semisimplicity" text="Cartan’s criterion" >}}).

Semisimple Lie algebras are the “non-abelian, non-solvable core” of general Lie algebras. The {{< knowl id="levi-decomposition-theorem" text="Levi decomposition" >}} expresses any finite-dimensional Lie algebra as a semidirect product of a semisimple Lie algebra with its solvable radical. Internally, every semisimple Lie algebra splits as a direct sum of {{< knowl id="simple-lie-algebra" text="simple" >}} ideals (see {{< knowl id="semisimple-direct-sum-simple" text="semisimple as a direct sum of simple ideals" >}}).

For complex semisimple Lie algebras, additional structure is encoded by roots (see {{< knowl id="root-lie-algebra" text="roots of a Lie algebra" >}}) and the associated {{< knowl id="root-system" text="root system" >}}.
