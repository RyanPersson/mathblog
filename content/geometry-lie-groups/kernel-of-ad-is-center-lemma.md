title: "Kernel of Ad and the center"
description: "For a connected Lie group, ker(Ad) equals the center."
---

Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}} with Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$, and let
\[
\mathrm{Ad}:G\to \mathrm{Aut}(\mathfrak g)
\]
be the {{< knowl id="adjoint-action-of-a-lie-group" text="adjoint representation" >}}, obtained by differentiating conjugation.

**Lemma (Kernel of Ad).**  

- For any Lie group $G$, the {{< knowl id="center-of-a-lie-group" text="center" >}} satisfies $Z(G)\subseteq \ker(\mathrm{Ad})$.
- If $G$ is connected, then $\ker(\mathrm{Ad})=Z(G)$.

More generally, for arbitrary (not necessarily connected) $G$, the kernel of $\mathrm{Ad}$ equals the centralizer of the identity component $G^\circ$.

**Proof idea (connected case).**  
If $\mathrm{Ad}_g=\mathrm{id}$, then conjugation by $g$ has derivative equal to the identity at $e$, hence acts trivially on $\mathfrak g$. This forces conjugation by $g$ to fix a neighborhood of $e$ (via the exponential chart from {{< knowl id="exponential-map-lie-group" text="the exponential map" >}}), and since $G$ is generated by any neighborhood of $e$ when connected, $g$ commutes with all of $G$.

**Context.**  
This lemma is used to relate faithfulness of the adjoint representation to the size of the center (compare {{< knowl id="adjoint-faithful-iff-discrete-center" text="Ad faithful iff center discrete" >}}) and to connect $\ker(\mathrm{Ad})$ with the infinitesimal statement {{< knowl id="kernel-of-ad-small-is-center-lemma" text="ker(ad) equals the Lie algebra center" >}}.
