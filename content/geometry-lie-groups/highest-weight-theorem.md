description: "Finite-dimensional irreducibles of a semisimple Lie algebra are classified by dominant integral highest weights."

Fix a complex semisimple {{< knowl id="lie-algebra" text="Lie algebra" >}} $\mathfrak g$, a {{< knowl id="cartan-subalgebra" text="Cartan subalgebra" >}} $\mathfrak h$, and a choice of positive roots (hence {{< knowl id="simple-root" text="simple roots" >}} and fundamental weights).

**Theorem (Highest-weight classification, Lie algebra form).**  

1. Every finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak g$-module is a {{< knowl id="highest-weight-representation" text="highest-weight representation" >}} with a unique {{< knowl id="highest-weight" text="highest weight" >}} $\lambda\in\mathfrak h^*$.
2. A weight $\lambda$ occurs as the highest weight of a finite-dimensional irreducible module if and only if $\lambda$ is **dominant integral** (i.e. it pairs with all simple coroots to give nonnegative integers).
3. For each dominant integral $\lambda$, there exists (up to isomorphism) a unique finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak g$-module $V(\lambda)$ with highest weight $\lambda$.

**Group form (compact groups).**  
If $G$ is a compact connected {{< knowl id="compact-lie-group" text="Lie group" >}} with maximal torus $T$ (see {{< knowl id="maximal-torus-theorem" text="maximal tori" >}}), then irreducible unitary representations of $G$ are similarly classified by dominant integral weights of $T$; differentiating recovers the Lie-algebra classification (compare {{< knowl id="differential-is-lie-algebra-homomorphism" text="differentiation of representations" >}}).

**Context.**  
This theorem is the conceptual reason that objects like {{< knowl id="fundamental-representation" text="fundamental representations" >}} (highest weights equal to fundamental weights) play a foundational role: they correspond to the vertices of the {{< knowl id="dynkin-diagram" text="Dynkin diagram" >}} and generate the dominant cone.
