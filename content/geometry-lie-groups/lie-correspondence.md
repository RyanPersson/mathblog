Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}} with Lie algebra $\mathfrak g=\operatorname{Lie}(G)$.

## Theorem (subgroup–subalgebra correspondence)
1. If $H\subseteq G$ is a connected {{< knowl id="lie-subgroup" text="Lie subgroup" >}}, then $\operatorname{Lie}(H)$ is a {{< knowl id="lie-subalgebra" text="Lie subalgebra" >}} of $\mathfrak g$ (by {{< knowl id="lie-algebra-of-subgroup-lemma" text="the Lie algebra of a subgroup lemma" >}}).

2. Conversely, for every Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak h\subseteq \mathfrak g$ there exists a unique **connected immersed** Lie subgroup $H\subseteq G$ such that
$$
\operatorname{Lie}(H)=\mathfrak h.
$$
This subgroup is often denoted $H=\langle \exp(\mathfrak h)\rangle$, emphasizing that it is generated by exponentials of elements of $\mathfrak h$ via the {{< knowl id="exponential-map-lie-group" text="exponential map" >}}.

3. The immersed subgroup $H$ is **embedded** if and only if it is **closed** in $G$; this is where {{< knowl id="closed-subgroup-theorem" text="closed subgroups are Lie subgroups" >}} becomes decisive.

## Motivation
This correspondence packages the idea that “connected subgroups are determined infinitesimally.” One often uses it in the form: a Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak h$ determines a unique connected subgroup, and computations can be done in $\mathfrak h$ using the bracket before passing back to $H$ (compare {{< knowl id="connected-subgroup-determined-by-algebra" text="connected subgroups are determined by their Lie algebra" >}}).

It is also a key input in global existence results such as {{< knowl id="lies-third-theorem" text="Lie’s third theorem" >}}, which asserts that every finite-dimensional Lie algebra integrates to a Lie group.
