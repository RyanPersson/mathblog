### Theorem (Weyl complete reducibility)
Let $\mathfrak g$ be a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic $0$ (in particular over $\mathbb C$). Then every finite-dimensional representation of $\mathfrak g$ is {{< knowl id="completely-reducible-representation-lie" text="completely reducible" >}}: if $W\subseteq V$ is a {{< knowl id="subrepresentation-lie-algebra" text="subrepresentation" >}}, there exists a $\mathfrak g$-invariant subspace $W'\subseteq V$ such that
$$
V = W \oplus W'.
$$
Equivalently, every representation is a direct sum of {{< knowl id="irreducible-representation-lie-algebra" text="irreducible representations" >}}.

### Compact Lie group analogue
If $G$ is a {{< knowl id="compact-lie-group" text="compact Lie group" >}}, then every finite-dimensional continuous representation of $G$ on a real or complex vector space admits a $G$-invariant inner product (obtained by averaging), hence is completely reducible. This is a key input to results like the {{< knowl id="peter-weyl-theorem" text="Peter–Weyl theorem" >}}.

### Context and consequences
Complete reducibility is the representation-theoretic backbone of highest-weight theory: it guarantees semisimplicity of the $\mathfrak h$-action and enables the {{< knowl id="weight-space" text="weight space decomposition" >}}, which in turn supports the classification of irreducibles by {{< knowl id="highest-weight" text="highest weights" >}}. It also interacts with structural criteria for semisimplicity, such as nondegeneracy of the {{< knowl id="killing-form" text="Killing form" >}} (compare {{< knowl id="tfae-semisimplicity-lie-algebra" text="equivalent characterizations of semisimplicity" >}}).
