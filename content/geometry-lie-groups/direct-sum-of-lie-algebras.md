description: "The product vector space with componentwise bracket, modeling Lie algebras of product groups."

Let $\mathfrak g$ and $\mathfrak h$ be {{< knowl id="lie-algebra" text="Lie algebras" >}} over the same field.

## Definition
The **direct sum Lie algebra** $\mathfrak g\oplus \mathfrak h$ is the direct sum as vector spaces equipped with the bracket
\[
[(X_1,Y_1),(X_2,Y_2)] := \bigl([X_1,X_2]_{\mathfrak g},\; [Y_1,Y_2]_{\mathfrak h}\bigr).
\]
With this bracket, the inclusions $\mathfrak g\hookrightarrow \mathfrak g\oplus\mathfrak h$ and $\mathfrak h\hookrightarrow \mathfrak g\oplus\mathfrak h$ are Lie algebra homomorphisms, and $\mathfrak g$ and $\mathfrak h$ commute inside the sum.

## Universal property
Giving a Lie algebra homomorphism $\mathfrak g\oplus\mathfrak h\to\mathfrak k$ is equivalent to giving homomorphisms $\mathfrak g\to\mathfrak k$ and $\mathfrak h\to\mathfrak k$ whose images commute.

## Relation to Lie groups
If $G$ and $H$ are Lie groups, then the Lie algebra of the {{< knowl id="product-lie-group" text="product Lie group" >}} $G\times H$ is canonically
\[
\mathrm{Lie}(G\times H)\cong \mathrm{Lie}(G)\oplus \mathrm{Lie}(H),
\]
as recorded in {{< knowl id="lie-algebra-of-product" text="Lie algebra of a product" >}}.

**Context.** Many decomposition results (e.g. {{< knowl id="semisimple-direct-sum-simple" text="semisimple as a direct sum of simples" >}}) are literally statements that a Lie algebra splits as a direct sum of ideals.
