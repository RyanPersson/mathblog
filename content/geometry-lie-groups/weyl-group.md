description: "A finite reflection group defined as $N_G(T)/T$ (or via root reflections) acting on the Cartan and its dual."

### Definition (Lie group version)
Let $G$ be a compact connected Lie group and let $T\subset G$ be a maximal torus (see {{< knowl id="maximal-torus-theorem" text="maximal tori" >}}). The **Weyl group** of $G$ is
$$
W(G,T)=N_G(T)/T,
$$
where $N_G(T)=\{g\in G\mid gTg^{-1}=T\}$ is the normalizer. It is a finite group, and it acts on $\mathfrak t=\mathrm{Lie}(T)$ by the adjoint action and hence on $\mathfrak t^\ast$ by duality.

### Definition (root system version)
For a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ with {{< knowl id="cartan-subalgebra" text="Cartan subalgebra" >}} $\mathfrak h$ and root system $\Delta\subset \mathfrak h^\ast$, the Weyl group can be described as the subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}(\mathfrak h^\ast)$ generated by reflections
$$
s_\alpha(\lambda)=\lambda-\lambda(H_\alpha)\,\alpha
$$
for $\alpha\in\Delta$, where $H_\alpha$ is the coroot. This realizes $W$ as a finite reflection group attached to the {{< knowl id="root-system" text="root system" >}}.

### Why it matters
The Weyl group controls much of the combinatorics of semisimple Lie theory:
- it permutes the roots and the {{< knowl id="weights-in-dual-cartan" text="weight lattice" >}};
- it identifies different choices of positive roots and simple roots (compare {{< knowl id="positive-root" text="positive roots" >}} and {{< knowl id="simple-root" text="simple roots" >}});
- it is encoded by the {{< knowl id="dynkin-diagram" text="Dynkin diagram" >}} and appears in classification and character formulas.
