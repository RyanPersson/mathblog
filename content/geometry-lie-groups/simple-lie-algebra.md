A finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ (over a field, typically of characteristic $0$) is **simple** if:

1. $\mathfrak g$ is not abelian (see {{< knowl id="abelian-lie-algebra" text="abelian Lie algebra" >}}), and  
2. the only ideals in $\mathfrak g$ are $0$ and $\mathfrak g$ itself (see {{< knowl id="ideal-lie-algebra" text="ideal" >}}).

Simplicity is the Lie-algebra analogue of “no nontrivial normal subgroups” in group theory, but formulated in terms of invariant subspaces under the adjoint action (see {{< knowl id="adjoint-representation-of-a-lie-algebra" text="adjoint representation" >}}). A basic immediate consequence is that any nonzero homomorphism out of a simple Lie algebra is injective (see {{< knowl id="lie-algebra-homomorphism" text="Lie algebra homomorphism" >}}).

Simple Lie algebras are the building blocks of semisimple ones: every {{< knowl id="semisimple-lie-algebra" text="semisimple Lie algebra" >}} decomposes as a direct sum of simple ideals (see {{< knowl id="semisimple-direct-sum-simple" text="semisimple direct sum simple" >}}). Over $\mathbb C$, the complete list of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras is given by the {{< knowl id="classification-simple-lie-algebras" text="Cartan–Killing classification" >}}.
