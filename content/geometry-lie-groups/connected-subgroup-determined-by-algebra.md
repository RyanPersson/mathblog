Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}}. The slogan “Lie algebra determines the connected subgroup” can be made precise as follows.

## Theorem (uniqueness)
If $H_1,H_2\subseteq G$ are connected {{< knowl id="lie-subgroup" text="Lie subgroups" >}} and
\[
\mathrm{Lie}(H_1)=\mathrm{Lie}(H_2)\subseteq \mathfrak g,
\]
then $H_1=H_2$.

Equivalently: for any {{< knowl id="lie-subalgebra" text="Lie subalgebra" >}} $\mathfrak h\subseteq \mathfrak g$, there is **at most one** connected Lie subgroup $H\subseteq G$ with $\mathrm{Lie}(H)=\mathfrak h$.

## Why this is true
One convenient way to see the mechanism is via the {{< knowl id="exponential-map-lie-group" text="exponential map" >}}. For a connected Lie subgroup $H$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak h$, the subgroup $H$ is generated by exponentials $\exp(\mathfrak h)$ (more precisely, by $\exp(U\cap \mathfrak h)$ for any sufficiently small neighborhood $U$ of $0$). Thus if two connected subgroups share $\mathfrak h$, they are generated by the same one-parameter subgroups and must coincide.

This uniqueness is one half of the {{< knowl id="lie-correspondence" text="Lie correspondence" >}} between connected subgroups and subalgebras; existence typically uses integrability of left-invariant distributions or the {{< knowl id="lies-third-theorem" text="third theorem of Lie" >}}.
