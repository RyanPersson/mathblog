### Definition
Let $\mathfrak g$ be a complex Lie algebra, $\mathfrak h\subseteq\mathfrak g$ an abelian subalgebra (typically a {{< knowl id="cartan-subalgebra" text="Cartan subalgebra" >}} in the semisimple setting), and let $\rho:\mathfrak g\to\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ be a representation. For $\lambda\in\mathfrak h^\ast$, the **$\lambda$-weight space** is
$$
V_\lambda=\{v\in V\mid \rho(H)v=\lambda(H)v\ \text{for all }H\in\mathfrak h\}.
$$
If $V_\lambda\neq 0$, then $\lambda$ is a {{< knowl id="weight-of-a-representation" text="weight of the representation" >}}.

### Interaction with roots (semisimple context)
When $\mathfrak g$ is semisimple and $\mathfrak h$ is a Cartan subalgebra, $\mathfrak g$ decomposes into {{< knowl id="root-space" text="root spaces" >}} $\mathfrak g_\alpha$ (see {{< knowl id="root-space-decomposition" text="root space decomposition" >}}). For $X\in \mathfrak g_\alpha$ and $v\in V_\lambda$, one has
$$
X\cdot v \in V_{\lambda+\alpha},
$$
so root vectors “shift” weights by roots.

### Context
For finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras, the action of $\mathfrak h$ is semisimple and one gets a direct sum decomposition
$$
V=\bigoplus_\lambda V_\lambda.
$$
This weight-space decomposition is one of the main inputs to highest-weight methods and depends crucially on complete reducibility phenomena (compare {{< knowl id="weyls-theorem-complete-reducibility" text="Weyl’s complete reducibility theorem" >}}).
