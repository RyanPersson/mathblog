Let $\mathfrak g,\mathfrak h$ be {{< knowl id="lie-algebra" text="Lie algebras" >}}.

## Definition
A **Lie algebra isomorphism** is a map $\varphi:\mathfrak g\to\mathfrak h$ that is
1. a {{< knowl id="lie-algebra-homomorphism" text="Lie algebra homomorphism" >}}, and
2. a bijection (equivalently, a linear isomorphism).

In this case the inverse map $\varphi^{-1}:\mathfrak h\to\mathfrak g$ is automatically a Lie algebra homomorphism as well, so $\mathfrak g$ and $\mathfrak h$ are “the same” as Lie algebras.

## Automorphisms
An isomorphism $\varphi:\mathfrak g\to\mathfrak g$ is a {{< knowl id="lie-algebra-automorphism" text="Lie algebra automorphism" >}}; the set of all such maps forms the group $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathfrak g)$ under composition.

## Context
Lie algebra isomorphism is the correct equivalence relation for “infinitesimal symmetry.” In particular, by {{< knowl id="lies-third-theorem" text="Lie’s third theorem" >}}, isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional Lie algebras correspond to connected, simply connected Lie groups up to isomorphism (see also {{< knowl id="simply-connected-determined-by-algebra" text="simply connected groups are determined by their Lie algebra" >}}).
