A **covering Lie group map** is a smooth homomorphism of {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie groups" >}}
\[
p:\widetilde G \longrightarrow G
\]
such that, as a map of topological spaces, $p$ is a covering map.

## Basic properties
Assume $\widetilde G$ is connected.

1. The differential at the identity,
   \[
   dp_e:\mathrm{Lie}(\widetilde G)\to \mathrm{Lie}(G),
   \]
   is a linear isomorphism (so $p$ identifies the two {{< knowl id="lie-algebra-of-a-lie-group" text="Lie algebras" >}}).

2. The kernel $\ker(p)$ is a {{< knowl id="discrete-subgroup" text="discrete subgroup" >}} of $\widetilde G$.

3. In fact, $\ker(p)$ lies in the {{< knowl id="center-of-a-lie-group" text="center" >}} $Z(\widetilde G)$: elements of the kernel act as deck transformations and must commute with the connected group generated by small neighborhoods of the identity.

Thus a covering homomorphism is a very rigid kind of quotient: it is (up to isomorphism) a quotient by a discrete central subgroup.

## Universal covers
For every connected Lie group $G$, there exists a simply connected Lie group $\widetilde G$ and a covering homomorphism $\widetilde G\to G$; this is the {{< knowl id="universal-covering-group-existence" text="existence of the universal covering group" >}}. The resulting {{< knowl id="universal-covering-group" text="universal covering group" >}} is unique up to unique isomorphism over $G$, and it is characterized by being {{< knowl id="simply-connected-lie-group" text="simply connected" >}} with $\mathrm{Lie}(\widetilde G)\cong \mathrm{Lie}(G)$.

**Context.** Many global topological features (fundamental group, discrete central quotients) are invisible to the Lie algebra. Covering maps are the standard way to pass between Lie-algebraic data and different global forms of the “same” local Lie group.
