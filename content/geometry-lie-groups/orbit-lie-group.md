title: "Orbit of a Lie group action"
description: "The set of points reachable from x under the action; it is an immersed homogeneous space."
---

Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}} acting smoothly on a manifold $M$; see {{< knowl id="smooth-action-lie-group" text="smooth Lie group actions" >}}. Fix $x\in M$.

## Definition
The **orbit** of $x$ is
$$
G\cdot x=\{g\cdot x \mid g\in G\}\subseteq M.
$$
The **orbit map** is $\Phi_x:G\to M$, $\Phi_x(g)=g\cdot x$.

The **stabilizer** (isotropy group) is
$$
G_x=\{g\in G\mid g\cdot x=x\},
$$
a subgroup of $G$; it is a {{< knowl id="stabilizer-lie-group" text="Lie subgroup" >}} because it is closed and {{< knowl id="closed-subgroup-theorem" text="closed subgroups are Lie subgroups" >}}.

## Theorem (orbit as a homogeneous space)
The orbit map $\Phi_x$ descends to a smooth map
$$
\overline{\Phi}_x: G/G_x \to M
$$
from the {{< knowl id="coset-space" text="coset space" >}} $G/G_x$, whose image is $G\cdot x$. Moreover:
- $\overline{\Phi}_x$ is an immersion, and $G\cdot x$ is an immersed submanifold of $M$.
- If the action is {{< knowl id="proper-action-lie" text="proper" >}}, then $\overline{\Phi}_x$ is an embedding, so each orbit is an embedded submanifold.

In particular, each orbit carries a canonical structure of a {{< knowl id="homogeneous-space" text="homogeneous space" >}} for $G$.

## Tangent space description
The differential of the orbit map at the identity gives the infinitesimal action map
$$
d(\Phi_x)_e:\mathfrak g \to T_xM,
$$
and its image equals $T_x(G\cdot x)$. This identifies tangent vectors to the orbit with values at $x$ of the fundamental vector fields generated by elements of $\mathfrak g$.

## Context
Orbit geometry is the local building block of the {{< knowl id="orbit-space" text="orbit space" >}} $M/G$, and transitivity of the action is exactly the condition that there is a single orbit (see {{< knowl id="transitive-action-lie" text="transitive actions" >}}).
