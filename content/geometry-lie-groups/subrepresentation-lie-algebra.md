description: "An invariant subspace for a Lie algebra representation, i.e. a -submodule."

### Definition
Let $\mathfrak g$ be a Lie algebra and let $\rho:\mathfrak g\to \mathfrak{gl}(V)$ be a {{< knowl id="representation-of-a-lie-algebra" text="representation of $\\mathfrak g$" >}} on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$. A linear subspace $W\subseteq V$ is a **subrepresentation** (or **$\mathfrak g$-submodule**) if it is invariant under the action:
$$
\rho(X)(W)\subseteq W \quad \text{for all } X\in\mathfrak g.
$$
In this case, restricting $\rho(X)$ to $W$ defines a representation $\rho|_W:\mathfrak g\to \mathfrak{gl}(W)$.

### Quotients and irreducibility
If $W\subseteq V$ is a subrepresentation, then the quotient space $V/W$ inherits a natural $\mathfrak g$-action via
$$
X\cdot (v+W) = (X\cdot v)+W,
$$
well-defined precisely because $W$ is invariant. A representation is **irreducible** (see {{< knowl id="irreducible-representation-lie-algebra" text="irreducible representations" >}}) if its only subrepresentations are $\{0\}$ and $V$.

### Why this matters
Subrepresentations are the “building blocks” for decomposing representations. When $\mathfrak g$ is semisimple, Weyl’s complete reducibility theorem (see {{< knowl id="weyls-theorem-complete-reducibility" text="Weyl’s theorem on complete reducibility" >}}) says every subrepresentation has an invariant complement, so finite-dimensional representations split as direct sums rather than forming nontrivial extensions.
