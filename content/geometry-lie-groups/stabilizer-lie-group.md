description: "For a smooth action , the stabilizer fixes a point and is a closed Lie subgroup."

### Definition
Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}} acting smoothly on a manifold $M$ via an action map $a:G\times M\to M$ (see {{< knowl id="smooth-action-lie-group" text="smooth actions of Lie groups" >}}). For a point $x\in M$, the **stabilizer** (or **isotropy subgroup**) at $x$ is
$$
G_x=\{g\in G\mid g\cdot x=x\}.
$$
It is a subgroup of $G$. Since it is the preimage of the closed set $\{x\}$ under the continuous map $g\mapsto g\cdot x$, it is closed in $G; $ hence $G_x$ is a {{< knowl id="closed-subgroup-lie-group" text="closed subgroup" >}}, and by the {{< knowl id="closed-subgroup-theorem" text="closed subgroup theorem" >}} it is automatically an embedded Lie subgroup.

### Lie algebra of the stabilizer
Let $\mathfrak g$ be the {{< knowl id="lie-algebra-of-a-lie-group" text="Lie algebra of $G$" >}}. For $X\in\mathfrak g$, let $X_M$ denote the fundamental vector field on $M$ generated by $X$ (equivalently, $X_M(x)=\frac{d}{dt}\big|_{t=0}\exp(tX)\cdot x$). Then the Lie algebra of $G_x$ is
$$
\mathfrak g_x=\{X\in\mathfrak g\mid X_M(x)=0\}.
$$

### Orbit–stabilizer geometry
The orbit $G\cdot x$ is an immersed submanifold (see {{< knowl id="orbit-lie-group" text="orbits of Lie group actions" >}}), and the natural map
$$
G/G_x \to G\cdot x,\quad gG_x\mapsto g\cdot x
$$
is a smooth bijection; under mild hypotheses (e.g. proper actions), it is a diffeomorphism. In the transitive case (see {{< knowl id="transitive-action-lie" text="transitive actions" >}}) this identifies $M$ with a {{< knowl id="homogeneous-space" text="homogeneous space" >}} of the form $G/G_x$ (compare {{< knowl id="coset-space" text="coset spaces" >}}).
