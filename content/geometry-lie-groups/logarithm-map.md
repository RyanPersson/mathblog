title: "Logarithm map"
description: "A local inverse to the exponential map near the identity of a Lie group."

Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}} with Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$.

## Definition
A **logarithm map** on $G$ is a smooth map
$$
\log:U\to \mathfrak g
$$
defined on an open neighborhood $U$ of the identity element $e\in G$ such that
$$
\exp(\log(g))=g \quad \text{for all } g\in U,
$$
where $\exp:\mathfrak g\to G$ is the {{< knowl id="exponential-map-lie-group" text="exponential map" >}}.

Equivalently, $\log$ is a (chosen) smooth local inverse to $\exp$ near $0\in\mathfrak g$. Existence follows from {{< knowl id="exponential-local-diffeomorphism" text="the fact that $\exp$ is a local diffeomorphism at $0$" >}}.

## Basic properties
- $\log(e)=0$ and $d(\log)_e$ is the inverse of $d(\exp)_0=\mathrm{id}_{\mathfrak g}$.
- $\log$ is generally **not** globally defined or single-valued on all of $G$ (even for compact groups).

## Concrete calculation (matrix groups)
If $G\subset \mathrm{GL}(n,\Bbb R)$ is a matrix Lie group and $A$ is sufficiently close to $I$, one has the convergent power series
$$
\log(I+X)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}X^k
\quad\text{for }\|X\|\text{ small},
$$
so for $A$ near $I$,
$$
\log(A)=\log\bigl(I+(A-I)\bigr)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}(A-I)^k.
$$
In particular, for $X\in \mathfrak g$ and $t$ small, $\log(\exp(tX))=tX$.

## Context
The logarithm is useful for “linearizing” group multiplication near the identity. For example, the product of two near-identity elements can be expressed in $\mathfrak g$ using the {{< knowl id="baker-campbell-hausdorff-formula" text="Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula" >}}, which compares $\log(gh)$ to $\log(g)+\log(h)$ with Lie bracket corrections.
