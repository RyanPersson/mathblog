A **connected Lie group** is a {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}} $G$ whose underlying topological space (hence smooth manifold) is connected.

A basic structural fact is that every Lie group has a distinguished connected, normal Lie subgroup: the **identity component**
\[
G^\circ := \text{the connected component of } e \in G.
\]
Then:

- $G^\circ$ is an open-and-closed embedded {{< knowl id="lie-subgroup" text="Lie subgroup" >}} and a {{< knowl id="normal-lie-subgroup" text="normal Lie subgroup" >}} of $G$.
- The connected components of $G$ are precisely the left (or right) cosets of $G^\circ$.
- The quotient $G/G^\circ$ is a discrete group (often called the component group).

The Lie algebra {{< knowl id="lie-algebra-of-a-lie-group" text="$\mathfrak g = \mathrm{Lie}(G)$" >}} controls the local connected structure through the {{< knowl id="exponential-map-lie-group" text="exponential map" >}}: for any neighborhood $U\subset \mathfrak g$ of $0$, the subgroup generated by $\exp(U)$ equals $G^\circ$. In particular, $G$ is connected iff it is generated by exponentials of elements of $\mathfrak g$.

**Context.** Many classification and representation-theoretic statements are stated for connected (or connected compact) groups because the discrete component group $G/G^\circ$ contributes separate, essentially “finite/discrete” data on top of the Lie-algebraic information.
