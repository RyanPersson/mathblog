Let $\mathfrak g$ be a {{< knowl id="lie-algebra" text="Lie algebra" >}}.

## Definition
The **lower central series** of $\mathfrak g$ is the descending sequence of ideals
$$
\gamma_1(\mathfrak g)=\mathfrak g,\qquad
\gamma_{k+1}(\mathfrak g)=[\mathfrak g,\gamma_k(\mathfrak g)] \quad (k\ge 1).
$$
Each $\gamma_k(\mathfrak g)$ is an {{< knowl id="ideal-lie-algebra" text="ideal" >}} because it is generated by brackets with $\mathfrak g$.

## Nilpotency
The Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ is {{< knowl id="nilpotent-lie-algebra" text="nilpotent" >}} if $\gamma_{s+1}(\mathfrak g)=0$ for some $s$; the smallest such $s$ is called the nilpotency class (or step).

This filtration is the Lie-algebra analogue of the lower central series of a group and is one of the standard equivalent characterizations recorded in {{< knowl id="tfae-nilpotency-lie-algebra" text="the TFAE criterion for nilpotency" >}}.

## Example (Heisenberg)
In the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra (see {{< knowl id="example-heisenberg-algebra" text="the Heisenberg algebra example" >}}) with basis $X,Y,Z$ and bracket $[X,Y]=Z$ (all other brackets between basis elements zero), one computes:
- $\gamma_1(\mathfrak g)=\langle X,Y,Z\rangle$,
- $\gamma_2(\mathfrak g)=[\mathfrak g,\mathfrak g]=\langle Z\rangle$,
- $\gamma_3(\mathfrak g)=[\mathfrak g,\langle Z\rangle]=0$ (since $Z$ is central).

So the Heisenberg algebra is nilpotent of class $2$.
