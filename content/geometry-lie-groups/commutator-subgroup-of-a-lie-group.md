Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}}.

**Definition.** The **commutator subgroup** (or derived subgroup) $[G,G]$ is the subgroup generated by all commutators
$$
[g,h]=ghg^{-1}h^{-1}\quad (g,h\in G).
$$
It is the smallest normal subgroup $N\triangleleft G$ such that $G/N$ is abelian; equivalently, $G/[G,G]$ is the abelianization of $G$.

**Lie-theoretic relation.** If $\mathfrak{g}=\mathrm{Lie}(G)$, then the Lie algebra of the identity component of $[G,G]$ is the {{< knowl id="derived-subalgebra" text="derived subalgebra" >}} $[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]$. This makes $[G,G]$ the global counterpart of “taking brackets” in $\mathfrak{g}$.

**Topological subtlety.** In general, $[G,G]$ need not be closed. When forming a smooth quotient, one often replaces it by its closure $\overline{[G,G]}$, which is a {{< knowl id="closed-subgroup-lie-group" text="closed subgroup" >}} and hence a Lie subgroup by the {{< knowl id="closed-subgroup-theorem" text="closed subgroup theorem" >}}.

**Context.** $G$ is {{< knowl id="abelian-lie-group" text="abelian" >}} precisely when $[G,G]$ is trivial, and the size of $[G,G]$ controls how far $G$ is from being commutative.
