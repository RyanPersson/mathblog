description: "A universal cone to a diagram, generalizing products, pullbacks, and equalizers."

## Definition
Let \(\mathcal{C}\) be a {{< knowl id="category" text="category" >}} and let \(J\) be an indexing category. A **diagram of shape \(J\)** in \(\mathcal{C}\) is a {{< knowl id="functor" text="functor" >}}
\[
D:J\to \mathcal{C}.
\]

A **cone** to \(D\) consists of an object \(L\) of \(\mathcal{C}\) together with morphisms
\[
\lambda_j: L \to D(j)\quad (j\in \mathrm{Ob}(J))
\]
such that for every morphism \(\alpha:j\to k\) in \(J\),
\[
D(\alpha)\circ \lambda_j = \lambda_k
\]
(using {{< knowl id="composition-category" text="composition" >}}).

A **limit** of \(D\) is a cone \((L,\lambda_j)\) such that for every other cone \((N,\nu_j)\) to \(D\), there exists a unique morphism \(m:N\to L\) with
\[
\lambda_j\circ m = \nu_j\quad\text{for all }j.
\]

One writes \(L = \varprojlim D\) (or \(\lim D\)). If a limit exists, it is unique up to unique {{< knowl id="isomorphism-category" text="isomorphism" >}}.

## Relationship to other constructions
- The dual notion is the {{< knowl id="colimit" text="colimit" >}}.
- Many familiar constructions are special limits (see examples below).

## Examples
### Example (Categorical product)
If \(J\) is the discrete category on two objects and \(D\) picks out objects \(X\) and \(Y\), then \(\lim D\) is the {{< knowl id="categorical-product" text="categorical product" >}} \(X\times Y\).

In \(\mathbf{Set}\), this recovers the usual {{< knowl id="cartesian-product" section="shared-foundations" text="cartesian product" >}} of sets.

### Example (Equalizer)
If \(J\) is the “parallel pair” shape \(A \rightrightarrows B\), then \(\lim D\) is the {{< knowl id="equalizer" text="equalizer" >}} of the two morphisms.

In \(\mathbf{Set}\), for functions \(f,g:A\to B\), the equalizer is the subset \(\{a\in A\mid f(a)=g(a)\}\).

### Example (Pullback)
If \(J\) is the cospan shape \(X\to Z \leftarrow Y\), then \(\lim D\) is the {{< knowl id="pullback" text="pullback" >}} \(X\times_Z Y\).

In \(\mathbf{Set}\), this is the fiber product \(\{(x,y)\in X\times Y \mid f(x)=g(y)\}\).
