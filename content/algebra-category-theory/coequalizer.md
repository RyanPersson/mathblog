title: "Coequalizer"
description: "A universal morphism that forces two parallel morphisms to become equal."
---

## Definition
Let \(\mathcal{C}\) be a {{< knowl id="category" text="category" >}} and let
\[
f,g : A \to B
\]
be parallel {{< knowl id="morphism" text="morphisms" >}} (same domain and codomain).

A **coequalizer** of \((f,g)\) is a morphism \(q:B\to Q\) such that:

1. (**Coequalizing condition**) \(q\circ f = q\circ g\) (using {{< knowl id="composition-category" text="composition" >}}), and
2. (**Universal property**) for every object \(X\) and morphism \(h:B\to X\) with \(h\circ f = h\circ g\), there exists a unique morphism \(u:Q\to X\) such that
   \[
   u\circ q = h.
   \]

Equivalently, \(q\) is **universal among morphisms out of \(B\)** that identify \(f\) and \(g\).

If a coequalizer exists, it is unique up to unique {{< knowl id="isomorphism-category" text="isomorphism" >}}.

## Relationship to other constructions
- A coequalizer is a special case of a {{< knowl id="colimit" text="colimit" >}}: it is the colimit of the diagram \(A \rightrightarrows B\).
- It is dual to an {{< knowl id="equalizer" text="equalizer" >}}.

## Examples
### Example (Set)
In \(\mathbf{Set}\), given functions \(f,g:A\to B\), form the smallest {{< knowl id="equivalence-relation" section="shared-foundations" text="equivalence relation" >}} \(\sim\) on \(B\) generated by relations
\[
f(a)\sim g(a)\quad \text{for all } a\in A.
\]
Then the coequalizer is the quotient map
\[
q:B \longrightarrow B/{\sim},
\]
where \(B/{\sim}\) is the {{< knowl id="quotient-set" section="shared-foundations" text="quotient set" >}}.

### Example (Grp)
In \(\mathbf{Grp}\), for homomorphisms \(f,g:A\to B\), let \(N\trianglelefteq B\) be the normal subgroup generated by all elements \(f(a)g(a)^{-1}\) (\(a\in A\)).  
Then the coequalizer is the quotient homomorphism
\[
q:B\to B/N.
\]

### Example (\(R\)-Mod)
In \(R\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}\), for \(R\)-linear maps \(f,g:A\to B\), the coequalizer is
\[
q:B \to B/\operatorname{im}(f-g).
\]
Equivalently, it is the {{< knowl id="cokernel-categorical" text="cokernel" >}} of \(f-g\) (computed in this abelian category).
