title: "Object"
description: "An entity of a category; morphisms go between objects."

## Definition
Let \(\mathcal C\) be a {{< knowl id="category" text="category" >}}. An **object** of \(\mathcal C\) is an element of the collection \(\mathrm{Ob}(\mathcal C)\).

An object has no “internal data” in the definition beyond belonging to \(\mathcal C\); its properties are typically expressed by the pattern of {{< knowl id="morphism" text="morphisms" >}} to and from it.

## Examples
1. In \(\mathbf{Set}\), an object is a {{< knowl id="set" section="shared-foundations" text="set" >}}.
2. In \(\mathbf{Grp}\), an object is a group.
3. In \(\mathbf{Top}\), an object is a topological space.
