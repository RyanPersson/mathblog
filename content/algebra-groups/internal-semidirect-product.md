title: "Internal Semidirect Product"
description: "A group generated by a normal subgroup and a complementary subgroup with trivial intersection"
---

Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} and let $N,H\le G$ be {{< knowl id="subgroup" text="subgroups" >}}. One says that **$G$ is the internal semidirect product of $N$ and $H$** if:
1. $N$ is a {{< knowl id="normal-subgroup" text="normal subgroup" >}},
2. $N\cap H=\{e\}$,
3. $NH=G$.

Conjugation by elements of $H$ defines a homomorphism $H\to \operatorname{Aut}(N)$ (coming from the {{< knowl id="conjugation-action" text="conjugation action" >}}), and with respect to this map one has an isomorphism
$$
G \cong N \rtimes H,
$$
so internal semidirect products are precisely the internal realizations of {{< knowl id="semidirect-product" text="semidirect products" >}}.

**Examples:**
- $S_3$ is an internal semidirect product of $A_3$ (normal, order $3$) and $\langle(12)\rangle$ (order $2$), hence $S_3\cong C_3\rtimes C_2$.
- $D_{2n}$ is an internal semidirect product of its rotation subgroup $C_n$ and a reflection subgroup $C_2$.
- If, in addition, $H$ is normal, then $G$ is an {{< knowl id="internal-direct-product" text="internal direct product" >}}.
