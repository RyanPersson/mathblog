description: "The descending series defined by iterated commutators with the whole group"

Let $G$ be a {{</* knowl id="group" text="group" */>}}. The **lower central series** of $G$ is the sequence of subgroups $(\gamma_n(G))_{n\ge 1}$ defined by
$
\gamma_1(G)=G,\qquad \gamma_{n+1}(G)=[\gamma_n(G),G]\ \ (n\ge 1),
$
where for subgroups $A,B\le G$ one writes
$
[A,B]=\langle [a,b] : a\in A,\ b\in B\rangle
$
for the subgroup generated by all {{</* knowl id="commutator" text="commutators" */>}} $[a,b]=a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$ with $a\in A$ and $b\in B$.

The series is descending: $\gamma_{n+1}(G)\le \gamma_n(G)$, and $\gamma_n(G)\lhd G$ for all $n$. Note that $\gamma_2(G)=[G,G]$ is the {{</* knowl id="commutator-subgroup" text="commutator subgroup" */>}}. A group is {{</* knowl id="nilpotent-group" text="nilpotent" */>}} if and only if $\gamma_{c+1}(G)$ is the {{</* knowl id="trivial-subgroup" text="trivial subgroup" */>}} for some $c\ge 1$; the least such $c$ is the nilpotency class.

**Examples:**
- If $G$ is abelian, then $\gamma_2(G)=\{e\}$, so the lower central series terminates immediately.
- For $S_3$, one has $\gamma_2(S_3)=A_3$, and in fact $\gamma_n(S_3)=A_3$ for all $n\ge 2$, so the series does not reach $\{e\}$; hence $S_3$ is not nilpotent.
- For the dihedral group $D_8$ of order $8$, the lower central series terminates after finitely many steps (indeed $D_8$ is nilpotent).
