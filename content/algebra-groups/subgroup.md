title: "Subgroup"
description: "A subset of a group that is itself a group under the same operation"
---

Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} with operation $\cdot$. A **subgroup** of $G$ is a {{< knowl id="subset" section="shared-foundations" text="subset" >}} $H\subseteq G$ such that:

1. $e\in H$ (where $e$ is the identity of $G$),
2. for all $a,b\in H$ we have $a\cdot b\in H$,
3. for all $a\in H$ we have $a^{-1}\in H$.

Equivalently, $H$ is a subgroup iff it is nonempty and closed under the one-step test $ab^{-1}\in H$; see the {{< knowl id="subgroup-test-one-step" text="subgroup test" >}}. Subgroups are the basic inputs for {{< knowl id="coset" text="cosets" >}} and for size constraints in finite groups via {{< knowl id="lagranges-theorem" text="Lagrange's theorem" >}}.

**Examples:**
- For $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, the set $n\mathbb{Z}=\{nk:k\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ is a subgroup of $(\mathbb{Z},+)$.
- The alternating group $A_n$ is a subgroup of $S_n$.
- The set of diagonal invertible matrices is a subgroup of the group of invertible matrices under multiplication.
