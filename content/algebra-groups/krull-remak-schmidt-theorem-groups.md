**Krull–Remak–Schmidt Theorem (Groups).**
Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} that satisfies both the ascending and descending chain conditions on {{< knowl id="normal-subgroup" text="normal subgroups" >}} (in particular, any finite group satisfies these conditions). Suppose
$$
G \cong G_1 \times \cdots \times G_n
$$
is a {{< knowl id="direct-product-groups" text="direct product" >}} decomposition in which each $G_i$ is nontrivial, normal in $G$, and **directly indecomposable** (meaning $G_i$ is not isomorphic to $A\times B$ with $A,B$ both nontrivial). If also
$$
G \cong H_1 \times \cdots \times H_m
$$
is another such decomposition with directly indecomposable normal factors, then $n=m$ and, after permuting indices, there are {{< knowl id="group-isomorphism" text="isomorphisms" >}} $G_i \cong H_i$ for all $i$.

Equivalently: the multiset of isomorphism types of directly indecomposable factors in an {{< knowl id="internal-direct-product" text="internal direct product" >}} decomposition is an invariant of $G$ (under the stated chain hypotheses). This is the group analogue of {{< knowl id="krull-schmidt-azumaya-theorem" section="algebra-modules" text="Krull–Schmidt–Azumaya for modules" >}}.

**Proof sketch.**
One compares projections of one decomposition onto the factors of the other, showing that indecomposability forces certain endomorphisms to be invertible or nilpotent. Chain conditions ensure termination of the resulting refinement process, yielding a bijection between indecomposable factors up to isomorphism.
