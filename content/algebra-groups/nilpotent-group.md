A **nilpotent group** is a {{</* knowl id="group" text="group" */>}} $G$ such that its {{</* knowl id="lower-central-series" text="lower central series" */>}} terminates at the trivial subgroup: there exists $c\ge 1$ with $\gamma_{c+1}(G)=\{e\}$, where $\gamma_1(G)=G$ and
$
\gamma_{k+1}(G) = [\gamma_k(G),G]
$
(the subgroup generated by commutators $x^{-1}y^{-1}xy$ with $x\in\gamma_k(G)$ and $y\in G$).

Equivalently, $G$ is nilpotent iff its {{</* knowl id="upper-central-series" text="upper central series" */>}} reaches $G$ in finitely many steps; in particular, nilpotent groups have large {{</* knowl id="center-of-group" text="centers" */>}} and are always {{</* knowl id="solvable-group" text="solvable" */>}}.

**Examples:**
- Every abelian group is nilpotent (of class $1$).
- Every finite {{</* knowl id="p-group" text="p-group" */>}} is nilpotent.
- The dihedral group of order $8$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$ are nilpotent.
- *(Non-example)* $S_3$ is not nilpotent.
