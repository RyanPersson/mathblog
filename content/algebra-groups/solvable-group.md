description: "A group whose derived series terminates at the trivial subgroup"

A **solvable group** is a {{</* knowl id="group" text="group" */>}} $G$ whose {{</* knowl id="derived-series" text="derived series" */>}} reaches the {{</* knowl id="trivial-subgroup" text="trivial subgroup" */>}} after finitely many steps; explicitly, there exists $n\ge 0$ such that $G^{(n)}=\{e\}$, where
- $G^{(0)}=G$, and
- $G^{(k+1)}=[G^{(k)},G^{(k)}]$ is the {{</* knowl id="commutator-subgroup" text="commutator subgroup" */>}} of $G^{(k)}$.

Equivalently, $G$ is solvable iff it has a finite {{</* knowl id="subnormal-series" text="subnormal series" */>}} whose successive quotients are {{</* knowl id="abelian-group" text="abelian" */>}}.

**Examples:**
- Every abelian group is solvable (the derived series hits $\{e\}$ in at most two steps).
- $S_3$ is solvable.
- *(Non-example)* $A_5$ is not solvable.
