title: "Sylow p-subgroup"
description: "A maximal p-subgroup of a finite group, of order equal to the largest p-power dividing the group order"
---

Let $G$ be a finite {{</* knowl id="group" text="group" */>}} and let $p$ be a prime. Write
$
|G|=p^n m
$
with $n\ge 0$ and $p\nmid m$ (so $p^n$ is the largest power of $p$ dividing $|G|$). A **Sylow $p$-subgroup** of $G$ is a {{</* knowl id="subgroup" text="subgroup" */>}} $P\le G$ such that $|P|=p^n$. In particular, every Sylow $p$-subgroup is a {{</* knowl id="p-group" text="$p$-group" */>}}.

The {{</* knowl id="sylows-first-theorem" text="first Sylow theorem" */>}} guarantees that Sylow $p$-subgroups exist whenever $p$ divides $|G|$. The {{</* knowl id="sylows-second-theorem" text="second Sylow theorem" */>}} states that any two Sylow $p$-subgroups are {{</* knowl id="conjugate-element" text="conjugate" */>}} (in the sense of conjugation of subgroups).

**Examples:**
- In $S_3$ (order $6=2\cdot 3$), Sylow $2$-subgroups have order $2$ (each is generated by a transposition), and the unique Sylow $3$-subgroup is $A_3$.
- In $A_4$ (order $12=2^2\cdot 3$), a Sylow $3$-subgroup has order $3$ and is generated by a $3$-cycle.
- If $|G|=p^n$, then $G$ itself is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup.
