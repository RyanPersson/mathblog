description: "A semigroup with an identity element"
---

A **monoid** is a {{</* knowl id="semigroup" text="semigroup" */>}} $(M,\cdot)$ together with an element $e\in M$ (called an identity element) such that for every $a\in M$,
$
e\cdot a = a \quad\text{and}\quad a\cdot e = a.
$

Monoids generalize {{</* knowl id="group" text="groups" */>}} by dropping the requirement that elements have inverses. Many monoids arise from {{</* knowl id="composition" text="composition" */>}} of endomorphisms (self-maps).

**Examples:**
- $(\mathbb{N},+,0)$ is a monoid.
- $(\mathbb{N},\times,1)$ is a monoid.
- For any set $X$, the set of all {{</* knowl id="function" text="functions" */>}} $X\to X$ is a monoid under composition, with identity $\mathrm{id}_X$.
- The set of all $n\times n$ real matrices is a monoid under multiplication, with identity matrix $I_n$; it is not a group because not every matrix is invertible.
