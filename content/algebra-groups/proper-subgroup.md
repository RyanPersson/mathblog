title: "Proper Subgroup"
description: "A subgroup that is strictly smaller than the whole group"
---

Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}}. A **proper subgroup** of $G$ is a {{< knowl id="subgroup" text="subgroup" >}} $H\le G$ such that $H\ne G$, equivalently $H$ is a {{< knowl id="proper-subset" section="shared-foundations" text="proper subset" >}} of $G$.

Proper subgroups capture "nontrivial internal structure" of a group: if $G$ has no nontrivial normal proper subgroups, then $G$ is simple.

**Examples:**
- $2\mathbb{Z}$ is a proper subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$.
- $A_n$ is a proper subgroup of $S_n$ for $n\ge 2$.
- The trivial subgroup $\{e\}$ is proper whenever $G$ is not the trivial group.
