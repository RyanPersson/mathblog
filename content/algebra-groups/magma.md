description: "A set with a binary operation (no other axioms)"

A **magma** (also called a *groupoid* in older literature) is a set $M$ together with a binary operation $\cdot : M \times M \to M$. No additional axioms are required—the operation need not be associative, commutative, or have an identity.

This is the most general algebraic structure with a single binary operation. All {{< knowl id="semigroup" text="semigroups" >}}, {{< knowl id="monoid" text="monoids" >}}, and {{< knowl id="group" text="groups" >}} are magmas.

**Examples:**
- Any set with any binary operation
- $(\mathbb{Z}, -)$ — integers under subtraction (not associative)
- Rock-paper-scissors with the "winner" operation
