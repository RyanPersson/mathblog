A **group epimorphism** is a {{< knowl id="group-homomorphism" text="group homomorphism" >}} $\varphi\colon G\to H$ that is surjective as a {{< knowl id="surjective-function" section="shared-foundations" text="surjective function" >}}.

Equivalently, $\varphi$ is an epimorphism if and only if its {{< knowl id="image-group" text="image" >}} equals all of $H$, i.e. $\varphi(G)=H$. Many natural epimorphisms arise as quotient maps: if $N\lhd G$ then the canonical projection $G\to$ {{< knowl id="quotient-group" text="quotient group" >}} $G/N$ is surjective.

**Examples:**
- The reduction map $\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is an epimorphism of additive groups.
- The projection $G\times H\to G$ is a group epimorphism.
- The sign map $\mathrm{sgn}\colon S_n\to\{\pm 1\}$ is a group epimorphism for $n\ge 2$.
