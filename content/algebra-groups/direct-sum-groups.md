title: "Direct Sum of Groups"
description: "The subgroup of a direct product with finite support"
---

Let $(G_i)_{i\in I}$ be a family of {{< knowl id="group" text="groups" >}} with identities $e_i$. The (external) **direct sum**
$$
\bigoplus_{i\in I} G_i
$$
is the subgroup of the {{< knowl id="direct-product-groups" text="direct product" >}} $\prod_{i\in I} G_i$ consisting of all tuples $(g_i)_{i\in I}$ such that $g_i=e_i$ for all but finitely many indices $i$ (this "all but finitely many" condition is called **finite support**).

For finite index sets $I$, the direct sum coincides with the direct product. In practice the term "direct sum" is most common for {{< knowl id="abelian-group" text="abelian groups" >}} and infinite families, where the finite-support condition matters.

**Examples:**
- If $I=\{1,\dots,n\}$ is finite, then $\bigoplus_{i=1}^n G_i=\prod_{i=1}^n G_i$ as groups.
- $\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathbb{Z}$ is the free abelian group on countably many generators (elements are integer sequences that are eventually $0$).
- $\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb{N}} C_2$ is the group of $\{0,1\}$-sequences with finitely many $1$'s under componentwise addition mod $2$.
