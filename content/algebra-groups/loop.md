description: "A quasigroup with an identity element"
---

A **loop** is a {{< knowl id="quasigroup" text="quasigroup" >}} with an identity element. That is, a set $L$ with a binary operation such that:

1. **Identity:** There exists $e \in L$ with $ea = ae = a$ for all $a \in L$
2. **Divisibility:** For all $a, b \in L$, the equations $ax = b$ and $ya = b$ have unique solutions

A loop that is also associative is a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}}. The smallest non-associative loop has 5 elements.

**Examples:**
- Unit octonions under multiplication (non-associative!)
- Moufang loops
- All groups are loops
