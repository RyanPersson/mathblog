**Proposition (Intersection of subgroups).**
Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} and let $\{H_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a family of {{< knowl id="subgroup" text="subgroups" >}} of $G$. Then the set-theoretic {{< knowl id="intersection" section="shared-foundations" text="intersection" >}}
$$
H \;=\; \bigcap_{i\in I} H_i
$$
is a subgroup of $G$.

**Context.**
This implies there is a smallest subgroup of $G$ containing any given subset (the intersection of all subgroups containing it), which underlies the notion of a generated subgroup.

**Proof sketch.**
Each $H_i$ contains the identity, so $H$ is nonempty. If $x,y\in H$, then $x,y\in H_i$ for all $i$, hence $xy^{-1}\in H_i$ for all $i$, so $xy^{-1}\in H$. Apply the one-step subgroup test.
