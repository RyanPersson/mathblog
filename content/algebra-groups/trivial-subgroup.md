title: "Trivial Subgroup"
description: "The subgroup consisting only of the identity element"
---

Let $G$ be a {{</* knowl id="group" text="group" */>}} with identity element $e$. The **trivial subgroup** of $G$ is the {{</* knowl id="subgroup" text="subgroup" */>}} $\{e\}$.

The trivial subgroup is the smallest subgroup of $G$ (by inclusion). It appears as an endpoint in definitions such as that of a {{</* knowl id="simple-group" text="simple group" */>}}.

**Examples:**
- In $(\mathbb{Z},+)$, the trivial subgroup is $\{0\}$.
- In $(\mathbb{R}^{\times},\times)$, the trivial subgroup is $\{1\}$.
- In any permutation group, the trivial subgroup consists of the identity permutation only.
