title: "Simple Group"
description: "A nontrivial group with no nontrivial normal subgroups"

A **simple group** is a {{</* knowl id="group" text="group" */>}} $G$ with $G\ne \{e\}$ such that the only {{</* knowl id="normal-subgroup" text="normal subgroups" */>}} of $G$ are the {{</* knowl id="trivial-subgroup" text="trivial subgroup" */>}} $\{e\}$ and $G$ itself.

Simple groups play the role of "building blocks" for general groups via composition series and uniqueness results such as the Jordan–Hölder theorem.

**Examples:**
- Any cyclic group of prime order is simple.
- The alternating group $A_5$ is a finite nonabelian simple group.
- *(Non-example)* $\mathbb{Z}$ is not simple: for instance, $2\mathbb{Z}$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup.
