title: "Automorphism Group"
description: "The group of all isomorphisms from a group to itself"
---

For a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} $G$, the **automorphism group** of $G$, denoted $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$, is the set of all {{< knowl id="group-isomorphism" text="group isomorphisms" >}} $\varphi:G\to G$, with group operation given by {{< knowl id="composition" section="shared-foundations" text="composition" >}}
$$
(\varphi\psi)(x) := \varphi(\psi(x)).
$$
The identity element is $\mathrm{id}_G$, and inverses are given by inverse maps.

Automorphisms are "symmetries" of $G$ that preserve the group structure. Many constructions (e.g. {{< knowl id="semidirect-product" text="semidirect products" >}}) are parametrized by homomorphisms into $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$.

**Examples:**
- $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{Z})\cong C_2$, since an automorphism is determined by where it sends $1$, and it must send $1$ to $\pm 1$.
- If $G=C_n$ is cyclic of order $n$, then $\operatorname{Aut}(G)\cong (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$ (units mod $n$).
- For $G\times H$, there are automorphisms that swap factors when $G\cong H$, and more generally automorphisms can mix factors in nontrivial ways.
