Let \(F\) be a {{< knowl id="field" section="algebra-rings" text="field" >}} and let \(f(x)\in F[x]\) be a nonconstant polynomial.

**Definition (splitting field).** A {{< knowl id="field-extension" text="field extension" >}} \(E/F\) is a *splitting field* of \(f\) over \(F\) if:
1. \(f\) *splits* over \(E\), i.e. in \(E[x]\) one can write
   \[
   f(x)=c\prod_{i=1}^n (x-\alpha_i)
   \quad \text{with } c\in E^\times,\ \alpha_i\in E;
   \]
2. \(E\) is generated over \(F\) by the roots of \(f\): if \(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n\) are the roots of \(f\) in \(E\) (with repetition allowed), then
   \[
   E = F(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n),
   \]
   i.e. \(E\) is obtained by adjoining those roots via a {{< knowl id="tower-of-fields" text="tower of fields" >}} of {{< knowl id="simple-extension" text="simple extensions" >}}.

Equivalently, after choosing an {{< knowl id="algebraic-closure" text="algebraic closure" >}} \(\overline F\) and viewing the roots of \(f\) inside \(\overline F\), the splitting field is the *smallest* subfield of \(\overline F\) containing \(F\) and all roots of \(f\).

A splitting field is always an {{< knowl id="algebraic-extension" text="algebraic extension" >}} of \(F\), and if \(f\) is separable then the splitting field is a {{< knowl id="separable-extension" text="separable extension" >}}. Existence and uniqueness up to \(F\)-isomorphism are addressed in {{< knowl id="splitting-field-existence-uniqueness" text="existence/uniqueness of splitting fields" >}} and {{< knowl id="splitting-field-uniqueness" text="uniqueness of splitting fields" >}}.

**Examples.**
1. Over \(F=\mathbb{Q}\), the polynomial \(f(x)=x^2-2\) splits in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\) as \((x-\sqrt2)(x+\sqrt2)\). Since \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt2)\) is generated by the roots, it is the splitting field.
2. Over \(F=\mathbb{Q}\), the polynomial \(f(x)=x^3-2\) has roots \(\sqrt[3]{2},\ \zeta_3\sqrt[3]{2},\ \zeta_3^2\sqrt[3]{2}\), where \(\zeta_3\) is a {{< knowl id="primitive-root-of-unity" text="primitive cube root of unity" >}}. Its splitting field is \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2},\zeta_3)\).
3. Over \(F=\mathbb{R}\), the polynomial \(x^2+1\) does not split in \(\mathbb{R}\) but splits in \(\mathbb{C}\). Since \(\mathbb{C}=\mathbb{R}(i)\) is generated by the roots \(\pm i\), it is the splitting field.
