title: "Uniqueness of Algebraic Closures"
description: "Any two algebraic closures of a field are isomorphic over the base field."

Let $K$ be a {{< knowl id="field" section="algebra-rings" text="field" >}}. An {{< knowl id="algebraic-closure" text="algebraic closure" >}} of $K$ is a {{< knowl id="field-extension" text="field extension" >}} $\Omega/K$ that is {{< knowl id="algebraic-extension" text="algebraic" >}} and algebraically closed.

**Theorem (uniqueness up to $K$-isomorphism).**  
If $\Omega$ and $\Omega'$ are algebraic closures of $K$, then there exists a field isomorphism
\[
\varphi:\Omega \xrightarrow{\ \sim\ } \Omega'
\]
such that $\varphi|_K=\mathrm{id}_K$. Equivalently, the algebraic closure of $K$ is *unique up to (non-canonical) isomorphism over $K$*.

A common way to phrase this is: once existence is known (see {{< knowl id="algebraic-closure-existence" text="existence of algebraic closures" >}}), “the” algebraic closure $\overline K$ is determined uniquely up to $K$-isomorphism.

**Useful strengthening.**  
Any $K$-embedding $\Omega\hookrightarrow \Omega'$ is automatically surjective, hence an isomorphism: the image is an algebraically closed subfield of $\Omega'$ that is algebraic over $K$, and an algebraic extension of an algebraically closed field must be trivial.

### Examples
1. **$K=\mathbb{Q}$.**  
   The field of algebraic numbers $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}\subset \mathbb{C}$ is an algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$. If $\Omega$ is any other algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$, the theorem gives a $\mathbb{Q}$-isomorphism $\Omega\cong \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, but there is no preferred (canonical) choice of such an isomorphism.

2. **$K=\mathbb{R}$.**  
   Since $\mathbb{C}=\mathbb{R}(i)$ is a {{< knowl id="simple-extension" text="simple extension" >}} generated by an algebraic element ($i^2+1=0$), the extension $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}$ is algebraic and $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed; hence $\mathbb{C}$ is an algebraic closure of $\mathbb{R}$. Uniqueness says any algebraic closure of $\mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbb{R}$-isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$. The non-canonicity is visible in the nontrivial {{< knowl id="field-automorphism" text="field automorphism" >}} of $\mathbb{C}$ over $\mathbb{R}$, namely complex conjugation.

3. **$K=\mathbb{F}_p$.**  
   One can build an algebraic closure of $\mathbb{F}_p$ as a union $\bigcup_{n\ge1}\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ inside a fixed ambient closure, where each $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ is a {{< knowl id="finite-field" text="finite field" >}} (compare {{< knowl id="finite-field-existence" text="existence of finite fields" >}}). The theorem implies any two such “unions of finite fields” are isomorphic over $\mathbb{F}_p$.
