description: "An extension E/F of the form E = F(α1,…,αn) for finitely many generators."

Let \(E/F\) be a {{< knowl id="field-extension" text="field extension" >}}. The extension \(E/F\) is **finitely generated** (as a field extension) if there exist elements \(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n\in E\) such that
\[
E = F(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n),
\]
where \(F(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)\) denotes the smallest subfield of \(E\) containing \(F\) and all \(\alpha_i\). Equivalently, \(E\) is generated as a field by a finite subset of \(E\) over \(F\).

The special case \(n=1\) is exactly a {{< knowl id="simple-extension" text="simple extension" >}}. Finitely generated extensions include both finite extensions (finite {{< knowl id="degree-of-extension" text="degree" >}}) and many transcendental extensions; for instance, adjoining one transcendental element already gives a finitely generated but typically infinite-degree extension.

When \([E:F]<\infty\), the extension is automatically finitely generated, and in many important cases it is even simple by the {{< knowl id="primitive-element-theorem" text="primitive element theorem" >}}.

### Examples
1. \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt2,\sqrt3)/\mathbb{Q}\) is finitely generated: \(E=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt2,\sqrt3)\) with two generators, and in fact it is an {{< knowl id="algebraic-extension" text="algebraic extension" >}}.
2. \(\mathbb{Q}(t)/\mathbb{Q}\) is finitely generated (one generator \(t\)) but is a {{< knowl id="transcendental-extension" text="transcendental extension" >}} of infinite degree.
3. \(\mathbb{Q}(t,\sqrt{t})/\mathbb{Q}\) is finitely generated: it is generated by \(t\) and \(\sqrt{t}\). It is transcendental over \(\mathbb{Q}\) (because it contains \(t\)), but the intermediate extension \(\mathbb{Q}(t,\sqrt{t})/\mathbb{Q}(t)\) is algebraic of degree \(2\) since \(\sqrt{t}\) satisfies \(x^2-t=0\).
