title: "Simple extension"
description: "An extension of the form E = F(α), generated by a single element α."

Let \(E/F\) be a {{< knowl id="field-extension" text="field extension" >}} and let \(\alpha\in E\). The **simple extension generated by \(\alpha\)** is the smallest subfield of \(E\) containing both \(F\) and \(\alpha\); it is denoted
\[
F(\alpha).
\]
Equivalently,
\[
F(\alpha)=\bigcap \{\,K \subseteq E : K \text{ is a field and } F\cup\{\alpha\}\subseteq K\,\}.
\]
If \(E=F(\alpha)\), then \(E/F\) is called a **simple extension**.

A useful description is: \(F(\alpha)\) consists of all rational expressions in \(\alpha\) with coefficients in \(F\), i.e.
\[
F(\alpha)=\left\{\frac{f(\alpha)}{g(\alpha)} : f,g\in F[x],\ g(\alpha)\neq 0\right\}.
\]
If \(\alpha\) is an {{< knowl id="algebraic-element" text="algebraic element" >}} over \(F\), then \(F(\alpha)/F\) is an {{< knowl id="algebraic-extension" text="algebraic extension" >}} and has finite {{< knowl id="degree-of-extension" text="degree" >}}. If \(\alpha\) is {{< knowl id="transcendental-element" text="transcendental" >}} over \(F\), then \(F(\alpha)/F\) is a {{< knowl id="transcendental-extension" text="transcendental extension" >}}.

Simple extensions are the building blocks of {{< knowl id="fg-field-extension" text="finitely generated field extensions" >}}: by definition, \(F(\alpha)\) is the finitely generated case with one generator.

### Examples
1. \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt2)/\mathbb{Q}\) is simple: \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt2)\) is the smallest field containing \(\mathbb{Q}\) and \(\sqrt2\).
2. \(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}\) is simple: \(\mathbb{C}=\mathbb{R}(i)\).
3. If \(t\) is an indeterminate, then \(\mathbb{Q}(t)/\mathbb{Q}\) is simple: it is generated (as a field) by the transcendental element \(t\).
