title: "Existence and uniqueness of splitting fields"
description: "Every nonconstant polynomial has a splitting field, unique up to K-isomorphism."

Let \(K\) be a {{< knowl id="field" section="algebra-rings" text="field" >}} and let \(f(x)\in K[x]\) be a nonconstant polynomial.

**Theorem (Splitting fields: existence and uniqueness).**
1. (**Existence**) There exists a {{< knowl id="field-extension" text="field extension" >}} \(L/K\) such that \(f\) factors in \(L[x]\) as a product of linear polynomials and \(L\) is generated by the roots of \(f\), i.e.
   \[
   L = K(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_r)
   \]
   where \(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_r\in L\) are all the roots of \(f\) in \(L\). Such an \(L\) is called a {{< knowl id="splitting-field" text="splitting field" >}} of \(f\) over \(K\). In particular, \(L/K\) is an {{< knowl id="algebraic-extension" text="algebraic extension" >}} and is finite.

2. (**Uniqueness up to \(K\)-isomorphism**) If \(L\) and \(L'\) are splitting fields of \(f\) over \(K\), then there is a \(K\)-isomorphism \(L \cong_K L'\). Equivalently: given a splitting field \(L\) of \(f\), any \(K\)-embedding of \(L\) into an algebraic closure of \(K\) is determined by the images of the roots and must send \(L\) onto another splitting field of \(f\).

A common construction of \(L\) adjoins roots one at a time using {{< knowl id="simple-extension" text="simple extensions" >}} and then uses the {{< knowl id="tower-law" text="tower law" >}} to control degrees.

### Examples
1. Over \(\mathbb{Q}\), \(f(x)=x^2-2\) has roots \(\pm\sqrt2\).  
   A splitting field is \(L=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt2)\), and \([L:\mathbb{Q}]=2\).

2. Over \(\mathbb{Q}\), \(f(x)=x^3-2\) has one real root \(\sqrt[3]{2}\) and two complex roots \(\zeta_3\sqrt[3]{2}\), \(\zeta_3^2\sqrt[3]{2}\), where \(\zeta_3\) is a primitive cube root of unity.  
   A splitting field is \(L=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2},\zeta_3)\). (This is also a basic example of a {{< knowl id="galois-extension" text="Galois extension" >}} once one checks normality and separability.)

3. Over \(\mathbb{F}_p\), the polynomial \(x^{p^n}-x\) has as its roots exactly the elements of \(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}\).  
   Its splitting field over \(\mathbb{F}_p\) is \(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}\), illustrating how {{< knowl id="finite-field" text="finite fields" >}} arise as splitting fields.
