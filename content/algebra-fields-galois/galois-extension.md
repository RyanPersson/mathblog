title: "Galois extension"
description: "An algebraic field extension that is both normal and separable."
---

Let \(K/F\) be an algebraic {{< knowl id="field-extension" text="field extension" >}}.

**Definition (Galois extension).** The extension \(K/F\) is *Galois* if it is both
- {{< knowl id="normal-extension" text="normal" >}}, and
- {{< knowl id="separable-extension" text="separable" >}}.

If \(K/F\) is finite, this is equivalent to saying that \(K\) is the {{< knowl id="splitting-field" text="splitting field" >}} of a separable polynomial \(f\in F[x]\). In that case, the {{< knowl id="galois-group" text="Galois group" >}} \(\mathrm{Gal}(K/F)\) has order \([K:F]\) (see {{< knowl id="galois-degree-equals-group-order" text="degree equals group order" >}}), and the base field \(F\) can be recovered as the {{< knowl id="fixed-field" text="fixed field" >}} of \(\mathrm{Gal}(K/F)\).

The equivalence between “normal + separable” and “Galois” is highlighted in {{< knowl id="separable-normal-galois" text="separable + normal ⇒ Galois" >}}.

**Examples.**
1. \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt2)/\mathbb{Q}\) is Galois: it is normal (splitting field of \(x^2-2\)) and separable (characteristic \(0\)).
2. The splitting field of \(x^3-2\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is \(K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2},\zeta_3)\). Since \(x^3-2\) is separable in characteristic \(0\), this splitting field is Galois over \(\mathbb{Q}\).
3. For finite fields, \(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}/\mathbb{F}_p\) is Galois; its Galois group is cyclic generated by Frobenius.
   By contrast, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})/\mathbb{Q}\) fails to be Galois because it is not normal, and \(\mathbb{F}_p(t^{1/p})/\mathbb{F}_p(t)\) fails because it is not separable.
