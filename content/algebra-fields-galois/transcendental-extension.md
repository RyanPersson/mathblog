description: "An extension E/F that contains at least one element transcendental over F (i.e. is not algebraic)."

A {{< knowl id="field-extension" text="field extension" >}} \(E/F\) is called a **transcendental extension** if it is not an {{< knowl id="algebraic-extension" text="algebraic extension" >}}. Equivalently, \(E/F\) is transcendental iff there exists some \(\alpha\in E\) that is a {{< knowl id="transcendental-element" text="transcendental element" >}} over \(F\).

Thus “transcendental” is an existence condition: it is enough for \(E\) to contain *one* transcendental element over \(F\). (Stronger notions such as “purely transcendental” impose additional structure, but are not part of the basic definition.)

### Examples
1. The rational function field \(F(t)\) is transcendental over \(F\): the element \(t\) is transcendental over \(F\), so \(F(t)/F\) is a {{< knowl id="simple-extension" text="simple" >}} transcendental extension.
2. \(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Q}\) is transcendental, since \(\mathbb{C}\) contains elements (e.g. \(\pi\)) that are transcendental over \(\mathbb{Q}\).
3. \(\mathbb{Q}(t,\sqrt2)/\mathbb{Q}\) is transcendental: it contains \(t\), which is transcendental over \(\mathbb{Q}\), even though \(\sqrt2\) is algebraic over \(\mathbb{Q}\).
