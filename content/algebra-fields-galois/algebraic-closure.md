Let \(F\) be a {{< knowl id="field" section="algebra-rings" text="field" >}}.

**Definition (algebraic closure).** An *algebraic closure* of \(F\) is a field \(\overline F\) equipped with an inclusion \(F\subseteq \overline F\) such that:
1. \(\overline F/F\) is an {{< knowl id="algebraic-extension" text="algebraic extension" >}}, i.e. every element of \(\overline F\) is algebraic over \(F\);
2. \(\overline F\) is *algebraically closed*: every nonconstant polynomial in \(\overline F[x]\) splits completely into linear factors over \(\overline F\).

In particular, every \(f(x)\in F[x]\) splits in \(\overline F[x]\), so \(\overline F\) contains a {{< knowl id="splitting-field" text="splitting field" >}} for every polynomial over \(F\).

Existence and uniqueness (up to \(F\)-isomorphism) are treated in {{< knowl id="algebraic-closure-existence" text="existence of algebraic closures" >}} and {{< knowl id="algebraic-closure-uniqueness" text="uniqueness of algebraic closures" >}}. A useful consequence is that any algebraic {{< knowl id="field-extension" text="field extension" >}} \(K/F\) admits an \(F\)-{{< knowl id="field-embedding" text="embedding" >}} into \(\overline F\).

**Examples.**
1. \(\mathbb{C}\) is an algebraic closure of \(\mathbb{R}\): it is algebraically closed, and \(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}\) is algebraic of degree \(2\) (generated by \(i\)).
2. Inside \(\mathbb{C}\), the set \(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}\) of algebraic numbers (complex numbers algebraic over \(\mathbb{Q}\)) forms an algebraic closure of \(\mathbb{Q}\).
3. For a {{< knowl id="finite-field" text="finite field" >}} \(\mathbb{F}_p\), one can realize an algebraic closure as
   \[
   \overline{\mathbb{F}_p}=\bigcup_{n\ge 1}\mathbb{F}_{p^n}
   \]
   inside a fixed large field, where \(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}\) ranges over all finite extensions of \(\mathbb{F}_p\).
