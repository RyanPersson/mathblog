A {{< knowl id="finite-field" text="finite field" >}} is a finite {{< knowl id="field" section="algebra-rings" text="field" >}}.

**Theorem (prime power cardinality and existence).**  
1. If $K$ is a finite field, then its {{< knowl id="characteristic" section="algebra-rings" text="characteristic" >}} is a prime $p$, and there exists an integer $n\ge 1$ such that
   \[
   |K|=p^n.
   \]
   Concretely, $K$ contains a copy of the prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$, and $K$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}_p$ of dimension $n$, so $|K|=p^n$.

2. Conversely, for every prime $p$ and integer $n\ge 1$ there exists a field of order $p^n$, usually denoted $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. One construction is:
   choose an irreducible polynomial $f(x)\in \mathbb{F}_p[x]$ of degree $n$ and set
   \[
   \mathbb{F}_{p^n}\ \cong\ \mathbb{F}_p[x]/(f).
   \]
   This gives a {{< knowl id="field-extension" text="field extension" >}} of degree $n$ (see {{< knowl id="degree-of-extension" text="degree of an extension" >}}) generated by a root of $f$, hence a {{< knowl id="simple-extension" text="simple extension" >}}.

A deeper refinement is that $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ is unique up to isomorphism (see {{< knowl id="finite-field-existence-uniqueness" text="existence and uniqueness of finite fields" >}}).

### Examples
1. **The prime fields $\mathbb{F}_p$.**  
   For any prime $p$, the quotient ring $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is a field, denoted $\mathbb{F}_p$, and has $p$ elements.

2. **A quadratic extension: $\mathbb{F}_4$.**  
   Over $\mathbb{F}_2$, the polynomial $x^2+x+1$ has no root (so it is irreducible). Thus
   \[
   \mathbb{F}_4 \cong \mathbb{F}_2[x]/(x^2+x+1),
   \]
   whose elements can be written $\{0,1,\alpha,\alpha+1\}$ with $\alpha^2=\alpha+1$.

3. **Another quadratic extension: $\mathbb{F}_9$.**  
   Over $\mathbb{F}_3$, the polynomial $x^2+1$ is irreducible (since $-1\equiv 2$ is not a square in $\mathbb{F}_3$). Hence
   \[
   \mathbb{F}_9 \cong \mathbb{F}_3[x]/(x^2+1),
   \]
   and every element has the form $a+b\beta$ with $a,b\in\mathbb{F}_3$ and $\beta^2=-1$.

(As a similar cubic example, one may construct $\mathbb{F}_8$ as $\mathbb{F}_2[x]/(f)$ for any irreducible cubic $f$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$.)
