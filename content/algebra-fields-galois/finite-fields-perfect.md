Let \(K\) be a finite {{< knowl id="field" section="algebra-rings" text="field" >}} of characteristic \(p>0\). The Frobenius map
\[
\mathrm{Fr}:K\to K,\quad x\mapsto x^p
\]
is a ring endomorphism (see {{< knowl id="frobenius-endomorphism" text="Frobenius endomorphism" >}}) and is automatically injective; finiteness forces it to be surjective, hence an automorphism. Therefore every element of \(K\) has a unique \(p\)-th root in \(K\), and more generally every algebraic extension of \(K\) is {{< knowl id="separable-extension" text="separable" >}}. In other words:

**Theorem.** Every finite field is {{< knowl id="perfect-field" text="perfect" >}}.

Equivalently, every irreducible polynomial over a finite field has distinct roots in an {{< knowl id="algebraic-closure" text="algebraic closure" >}} (cf. {{< knowl id="separable-distinct-roots" text="separable polynomials have distinct roots" >}}).

### Examples

1. **Prime fields.**  
   \(\mathbb{F}_p\) is perfect: \(\mathrm{Fr}(x)=x^p\) is the identity map on \(\mathbb{F}_p\), hence an automorphism.

2. **Degree-\(n\) finite fields.**  
   For \(K=\mathbb{F}_{p^n}\), Frobenius is an automorphism of order \(n\), and the extension \(K/\mathbb{F}_p\) is {{< knowl id="galois-extension" text="Galois" >}} with cyclic {{< knowl id="galois-group" text="Galois group" >}} generated by Frobenius (see {{< knowl id="finite-field-galois-group-cyclic" text="finite-field Galois group is cyclic" >}}).

3. **Contrast with an infinite non-perfect field.**  
   \(\mathbb{F}_p(t)\) is not perfect: \(t\) has no \(p\)-th root in \(\mathbb{F}_p(t)\), and \(x^p-t\) defines an inseparable finite extension (as in {{< knowl id="finite-extension-perfect-separable" text="perfect implies separable" >}}).
