title: "Flatness implies holonomy depends only on homotopy class of loops"
description: "For a flat connection, holonomy around a loop depends only on the loop's based homotopy class."

Let \(\pi:P\to M\) be a {{< knowl id="principal-g-bundle" text="principal G-bundle" >}} with a {{< knowl id="principal-connection" text="principal connection" >}} \(\omega\). Fix a basepoint \(x\in M\) and a point \(p\in P_x\). For a piecewise smooth loop \(\gamma\) based at \(x\), horizontal lifting gives an element \(\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(\gamma)\in G\), and the subgroup generated by such elements is the {{< knowl id="holonomy-group" text="holonomy group" >}} at \(p\). Let \(\Omega\) denote the {{< knowl id="curvature" text="curvature" >}} of \(\omega\).

## Proposition (homotopy invariance of holonomy under flatness)
If \(\Omega=0\), then for any two piecewise smooth loops \(\gamma_0,\gamma_1\) based at \(x\) that are homotopic through based loops, one has
\[
\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(\gamma_0)=\mathrm{Hol}_{p}(\gamma_1).
\]
Consequently, the assignment \([\gamma]\mapsto \mathrm{Hol}_{p}(\gamma)\) defines a group homomorphism
\[
\pi_1(M,x)\longrightarrow G,
\]
and changing the choice of \(p\in P_x\) conjugates this homomorphism by an element of \(G\).

This is the precise sense in which a flat connection has “holonomy depending only on homotopy class.”

## Examples
1. **Trivial flat connection.** On \(P=M\times G\) with the zero connection, every loop has holonomy \(e\in G\), so the induced homomorphism \(\pi_1(M,x)\to G\) is trivial.
2. **Flat \(U(1)\)-connections on \(S^1\).** For a connection with constant local 1-form \(A=\lambda\,d\theta\) (in a global gauge), curvature is zero and holonomy sends the generator of \(\pi_1(S^1)\cong \mathbb Z\) to \(e^{2\pi i\lambda}\in U(1)\); dependence is only on the winding number.
3. **Möbius bundle as \(O(1)\)-bundle.** The Möbius line bundle corresponds to a principal \(O(1)\cong\{\pm 1\}\)-bundle with a flat connection whose holonomy representation sends the generator of \(\pi_1(S^1)\) to \(-1\).
