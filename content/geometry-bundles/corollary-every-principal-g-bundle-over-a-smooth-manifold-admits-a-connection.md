title: "Every principal bundle admits a connection"
description: "Any principal bundle over a smooth manifold admits at least one principal connection."
---

Let \(M\) be a {{< knowl id="smooth-manifold" text="smooth manifold" >}} and let \(\pi:P\to M\) be a {{< knowl id="principal-g-bundle" text="principal G-bundle" >}} with Lie structure group \(G\).

## Corollary (existence of principal connections)
There exists at least one {{< knowl id="principal-connection" text="principal connection" >}} on \(P\).

In particular, the affine space \(\mathrm{Conn}(P)\) is nonempty for every principal bundle over a smooth manifold.

## Examples
1. **Trivial bundle.** On \(P=M\times G\), the product horizontal distribution \(T_xM\subset T_{(x,g)}(M\times G)\) defines a principal connection (the “zero” connection in a global gauge).
2. **Hopf fibration.** The principal \(U(1)\)-bundle \(S^3\to S^2\) admits a natural connection whose horizontal distribution is the contact distribution on \(S^3\); this yields the standard magnetic monopole connection on \(S^2\) in local gauges.
3. **Frame bundles.** The frame bundle of a vector bundle (in particular, the frame bundle of \(TM\)) admits principal connections; choosing a Riemannian metric yields the Levi–Civita connection on the orthonormal frame bundle.
