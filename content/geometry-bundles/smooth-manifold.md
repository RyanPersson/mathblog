description: "A topological manifold equipped with a maximal smooth atlas, enabling calculus in local coordinates."

## Definition
Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$. An **$n$-dimensional smooth manifold** is a pair $(M,\mathcal A)$ such that

- $M$ is an $n$-dimensional topological manifold (Hausdorff, second countable, and every $p\in M$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$), and
- $\mathcal A$ is a **maximal** {{< knowl id="smooth-atlas" text="smooth atlas" >}} of {{< knowl id="smooth-chart-coordinate-chart" text="coordinate charts" >}} on $M$.

Maximal means: if $(U,\varphi)$ is a chart on $M$ whose transition maps with every chart in $\mathcal A$ are smooth, then $(U,\varphi)\in\mathcal A$. Any (not-necessarily-maximal) smooth atlas determines a unique maximal one by adjoining all charts smoothly compatible with it.

Once a smooth structure is fixed, one can define intrinsic objects such as the {{< knowl id="tangent-space-at-a-point" text="tangent space at a point" >}}, the {{< knowl id="tangent-bundle" text="tangent bundle" >}}, and differential forms with the {{< knowl id="exterior-derivative" text="exterior derivative" >}}. Maps between smooth manifolds are compared using charts; see {{< knowl id="smooth-map" text="smooth maps" >}}.

## Examples
1. $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the single global chart $(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathrm{id})$ is a smooth manifold; its maximal atlas consists of all charts whose coordinate changes are smooth.
2. The sphere $S^n\subset\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ becomes a smooth manifold using the two stereographic projection charts from the north and south poles; their overlap transition map is smooth, so they generate a maximal smooth atlas.
3. Any {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}} is, by definition, a smooth manifold for which multiplication and inversion are {{< knowl id="smooth-map" text="smooth maps" >}}.
