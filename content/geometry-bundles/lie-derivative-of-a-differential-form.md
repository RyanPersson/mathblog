title: "Lie derivative of a differential form"
description: "The derivative {L}_X of a form along a vector field , characterized by Cartan’s formula."
---

Let \(M\) be a {{< knowl id="smooth-manifold" text="smooth manifold" >}} and let \(X\) be a {{< knowl id="vector-field" text="vector field" >}} on \(M\). The **Lie derivative** differentiates tensor fields, and in particular {{< knowl id="differential-k-form" text="differential forms" >}}, along the flow of \(X\).

## Definition (via the flow)
Let \(\varphi_t:M\to M\) be the (local) flow generated by \(X\). For a \(k\)-form \(\omega\in\Omega^k(M)\), the **Lie derivative** of \(\omega\) along \(X\) is
\[
\mathcal{L}_X\omega \coloneqq \left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0} \bigl(\varphi_t^*\omega\bigr),
\]
where \(\varphi_t^*\) denotes the {{< knowl id="pullback-of-differential-forms" text="pullback of differential forms" >}}.

## Cartan’s formula
The Lie derivative can be computed without explicitly using the flow, via **Cartan’s magic formula**:
\[
\mathcal{L}_X\omega = d(\iota_X\omega) + \iota_X(d\omega).
\]
Here \(\iota_X\) is the {{< knowl id="interior-product-contraction-x" text="interior product (contraction)" >}} with \(X\), and \(d\) is the {{< knowl id="exterior-derivative" text="exterior derivative" >}}.

## Key properties
For \(\alpha\in\Omega^k(M)\) and \(\beta\in\Omega^\ell(M)\):

- **Degree 0 derivation with respect to the** {{< knowl id="wedge-product-of-differential-forms" text="wedge product" >}}:
  \[
  \mathcal{L}_X(\alpha\wedge\beta)=(\mathcal{L}_X\alpha)\wedge\beta+\alpha\wedge(\mathcal{L}_X\beta).
  \]
- **Commutes with the exterior derivative:**
  \[
  \mathcal{L}_X(d\omega)=d(\mathcal{L}_X\omega).
  \]
- **On functions:** for \(f\in C^\infty(M)\), \(\mathcal{L}_X f = X(f)\).

## Examples
1. **Translation on \(\mathbb{R}^n\).**  
   On \(\mathbb{R}^n\), let \(X=\partial/\partial x^1\). For the 1-form \(\omega=f(x)\,dx^2\),
   \[
   \mathcal{L}_X\omega = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^1}\,dx^2,
   \]
   and in particular \(\mathcal{L}_X(dx^2)=0\).

2. **Radial vector field scales the area form on \(\mathbb{R}^2\).**  
   On \(\mathbb{R}^2\) with coordinates \((x,y)\), let \(X=x\,\partial_x+y\,\partial_y\). For the standard 2-form \(\mu=dx\wedge dy\), one computes
   \[
   \mathcal{L}_X\mu = 2\,\mu,
   \]
   reflecting that the flow of \(X\) is dilation by \(e^t\), which scales area by \(e^{2t}\).

3. **Rotations preserve the standard area form on \(\mathbb{R}^2\).**  
   Let \(X=-y\,\partial_x + x\,\partial_y\), whose flow is rotation. Then
   \[
   \mathcal{L}_X(dx\wedge dy)=0,
   \]
   expressing invariance of the area form under rotations.
