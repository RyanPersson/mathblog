Let $G$ act on a manifold $M$.

## Definition
The **quotient space of the action** (also called the **orbit space**) is the set of {{< knowl id="orbit-of-a-group-action" text="orbits" >}}
\[
M/G := \{\, G\cdot x \mid x\in M\,\},
\]
equipped with the **quotient topology** for the canonical surjection
\[
\pi:M\to M/G,\qquad \pi(x)=G\cdot x.
\]
Concretely, a subset $U\subseteq M/G$ is open if and only if $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is open in $M$.

In general $M/G$ need not be a manifold (it may fail to be Hausdorff or locally Euclidean). Under the stronger hypothesis of a {{< knowl id="principal-action" text="principal action" >}}, the orbit space becomes a smooth manifold (see {{< knowl id="quotient-manifold" text="quotient manifold" >}}).

## Examples
1. **Rotations of the plane.** For $SO(2)\curvearrowright \mathbb{R}^2$, the quotient $\mathbb{R}^2/SO(2)$ is naturally homeomorphic to $[0,\infty)$ via the radius function.
2. **Translations by integers.** For the action of $\mathbb{Z}$ on $\mathbb{R}$ by translations, the quotient $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ is (homeomorphic to) the circle $S^1$.
3. **Conjugacy classes.** For the conjugation action of a Lie group on itself, $G/G$ is the set of conjugacy classes; for many noncompact groups this quotient is not Hausdorff.
