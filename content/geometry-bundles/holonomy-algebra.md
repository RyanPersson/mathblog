description: "The Lie algebra generated by parallel transport around loops for a given connection."

Let $\pi\colon P\to M$ be a {{< knowl id="principal-g-bundle" text="principal G-bundle" >}} with structure group $G$, and let $\omega$ be a {{< knowl id="principal-connection" text="principal connection" >}} on $P$.

Choose a basepoint $x\in M$ and a point $p\in P_x$ in the fiber.

## Definition (Holonomy algebra)
The {{< knowl id="holonomy-group" text="holonomy group" >}} $\mathrm{Hol}_p(\omega)\subset G$ is the subgroup consisting of all elements obtained by {{< knowl id="parallel-transport" text="parallel transport" >}} along piecewise smooth loops in $M$ based at $x$, lifted horizontally starting at $p$.

The **holonomy algebra** at $p$ is the Lie algebra
\[
\mathfrak{hol}_p(\omega) := \mathrm{Lie}\bigl(\mathrm{Hol}_p(\omega)\bigr)\subset \mathfrak{g},
\]
where $\mathfrak{g}$ is the {{< knowl id="lie-algebra" text="Lie algebra" >}} of $G$.

If $p$ is replaced by $p\cdot g$ in the same fiber, then $\mathrm{Hol}_{p\cdot g}(\omega)=g^{-1}\mathrm{Hol}_p(\omega)g$, so $\mathfrak{hol}_p(\omega)$ is well-defined up to conjugacy in $\mathfrak{g}$.

A key structural result is that $\mathfrak{hol}_p(\omega)$ is generated by curvature (see {{< knowl id="ambrosesinger-curvature-span" text="Ambrose–Singer curvature span" >}}).

## Examples
1. **Flat connections.** If the {{< knowl id="curvature" text="curvature" >}} of $\omega$ vanishes, then $\mathfrak{hol}_p(\omega)=0$ (and the holonomy group is locally constant).
2. **Generic Riemannian holonomy.** For a generic Riemannian metric in dimension $n$, the Levi–Civita connection has holonomy algebra $\mathfrak{so}(n)$.
3. **Product structures.** On a Riemannian product $M_1\times M_2$ with product metric, the holonomy algebra splits as a direct sum corresponding to the factors, reflecting the decomposition of parallel transport.
