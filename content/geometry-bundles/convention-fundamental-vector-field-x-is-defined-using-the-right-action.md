title: "Convention: fundamental vector field uses the right action"
description: "The fundamental vector field X-sharp is defined by differentiating the right action p·exp(tX)."

Let $\pi:P\to M$ be a {{< knowl id="principal-g-bundle" text="principal G-bundle" >}} with the right action $(p,g)\mapsto p\cdot g$ as in {{< knowl id="convention-principal-bundles-use-a-right-g-action-on-p" text="the right-action convention" >}}. Let $\mathfrak g$ be the {{< knowl id="lie-algebra" text="Lie algebra" >}} of $G$.

## Convention
For $X\in\mathfrak g$, the **fundamental vector field** (also called the infinitesimal generator) is the {{< knowl id="vector-field" text="vector field" >}} $X^\#\in\Gamma(TP)$ defined by
\[
X^\#_p \;:=\; \left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0} \big(p\cdot \exp(tX)\big),\qquad p\in P.
\]

With this convention:
- $X^\#$ is vertical and $\pi_*X^\#=0$.
- The connection 1-form $\omega$ satisfies $\omega(X^\#)=X$.
- Right translation behaves by $(R_g)_*X^\# = (\mathrm{Ad}(g^{-1})X)^\#$.

This fixes sign conventions in identities involving {{< knowl id="lie-bracket" text="Lie brackets" >}} of fundamental fields and in the structure equations for connections and curvature.

## Examples
1. **Trivial bundle.** If $P=M\times G$ with right action $(x,h)\cdot g=(x,hg)$, then at $(x,h)$ one has
   \[
   X^\#_{(x,h)}=(0,\ (R_h)_*X),
   \]
   i.e. the fundamental field points purely along the $G$-factor.

2. **Right-invariant fields on $G$.** On $P=G$ viewed as a principal $G$-bundle over a point with right action by right multiplication, $X^\#$ is precisely the right-invariant vector field generated by $X$.

3. **Sign comparison with a left action.** If one instead defined fundamental fields using a left action $L_{\exp(tX)}$, the resulting infinitesimal generator differs by a sign in formulas relating brackets and the adjoint action; the present convention avoids that mismatch for principal bundles written with right actions.
