description: "A cohomology theory for manifolds with a Lie group action, computed by the Cartan complex of equivariant differential forms."

Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}} acting smoothly on a manifold $M$. Write $\mathfrak{g}$ for the {{< knowl id="lie-algebra" text="Lie algebra" >}} of $G$.

Equivariant cohomology can be defined topologically as the cohomology of the Borel construction $EG\times_G M$, where $EG\to BG$ is the {{< knowl id="universal-principal-bundle-egbg" text="universal principal bundle" >}}. When $G$ is compact, it admits a de Rham model: the Cartan model.

## Definition (Cartan complex and equivariant cohomology)
Let $\Omega^*(M)$ denote the graded algebra of differential forms (see {{< knowl id="differential-k-form" text="differential forms" >}}), and let $S(\mathfrak{g}^*)$ be the symmetric algebra on $\mathfrak{g}^*$, graded so that elements of $\mathfrak{g}^*$ have degree 2.

The **Cartan complex** of the $G$-manifold $M$ is
\[
\Omega_G^*(M) := \bigl(S(\mathfrak{g}^*)\otimes \Omega^*(M)\bigr)^G,
\]
the $G$-invariant elements, equipped with the Cartan differential $d_G$ defined by the rule
\[
(d_G\alpha)(\xi) = d(\alpha(\xi)) - \iota_{\xi_M}\alpha(\xi),
\]
where $d$ is the {{< knowl id="exterior-derivative" text="exterior derivative" >}}, $\xi_M$ is the fundamental {{< knowl id="vector-field" text="vector field" >}} on $M$ generated by $\xi\in\mathfrak{g}$, and $\alpha$ is viewed as a polynomial map $\mathfrak{g}\to \Omega^*(M)$.

The **equivariant cohomology** of $M$ (Cartan model) is
\[
H_G^*(M) := H^*(\Omega_G^*(M), d_G).
\]

## Examples
1. **Point.** If $M=\mathrm{pt}$, then $\Omega^*(M)=\mathbb{R}$ and $H_G^*(\mathrm{pt}) \cong H^*(BG)$.
2. **Trivial action.** If $G$ acts trivially on $M$, then $H_G^*(M)$ is naturally isomorphic to $H^*(M)\otimes H^*(BG)$ (over a field of characteristic 0).
3. **Free action.** If $G$ acts freely and properly so that $M\to M/G$ is a principal bundle, then $H_G^*(M)\cong H^*(M/G)$.
