title: "Ambrose–Singer curvature span"
description: "The theorem that the holonomy algebra is generated by curvature values transported back to a basepoint."
---

Let $\pi\colon P\to M$ be a principal $G$-bundle and let $\omega$ be a {{< knowl id="principal-connection" text="principal connection" >}} with {{< knowl id="curvature" text="curvature" >}} 2-form $\Omega\in \Omega^2(P;\mathfrak{g})$.

Fix $p\in P$.

## Theorem (Ambrose–Singer)
Let $\mathfrak{hol}_p(\omega)\subset \mathfrak{g}$ be the {{< knowl id="holonomy-algebra" text="holonomy algebra" >}} at $p$. Then $\mathfrak{hol}_p(\omega)$ is the smallest Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$ containing all elements of the form
\[
\mathrm{Ad}(g^{-1})\bigl(\Omega_q(X,Y)\bigr),
\]
where:

- $q\in P$ can be reached from $p$ by horizontal transport along some piecewise smooth path in $M$,
- $X,Y\in T_qP$ are horizontal tangent vectors at $q$,
- $g\in G$ is the unique element such that horizontal transport along the chosen path sends $p$ to $q\cdot g$.

In words: the holonomy algebra is generated by curvature values computed at points reached by {{< knowl id="parallel-transport" text="parallel transport" >}}, transported back to the basepoint by the adjoint action.

## Examples
1. **Curvature zero implies trivial holonomy algebra.** If $\Omega\equiv 0$, then every generator above is zero, hence $\mathfrak{hol}_p(\omega)=0$.
2. **Constant-curvature Riemannian metrics.** For the Levi–Civita connection of a round sphere, the curvature endomorphisms span $\mathfrak{so}(n)$, so the holonomy algebra is all of $\mathfrak{so}(n)$.
3. **Reduced structure group.** If a connection reduces to a subgroup $H\subset G$ (so its connection form takes values in $\mathfrak{h}$), then every curvature value lies in $\mathfrak{h}$ and the holonomy algebra is contained in $\mathfrak{h}$.
