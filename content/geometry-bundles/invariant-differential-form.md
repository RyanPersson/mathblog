Let $G$ act on a manifold $M$ by a {{< knowl id="smooth-action-of-a-lie-group-on-a-manifold" text="smooth action" >}}.

## Definition
A {{< knowl id="differential-k-form" text="differential k-form" >}} $\omega\in \Omega^k(M)$ is **$G$-invariant** if for every $g\in G$,
\[
(\Phi_g)^*\omega = \omega,
\]
where $\Phi_g:M\to M$ is the diffeomorphism $x\mapsto g\cdot x$.

If $G$ is connected, this is equivalent to infinitesimal invariance: for every $X$ in the Lie algebra, the Lie derivative satisfies $\mathcal{L}_{X_M}\omega=0$, where $X_M$ is the vector field generated by $X$.

Invariant forms form a subcomplex of the de Rham complex: if $\omega$ is invariant, then so is {{< knowl id="exterior-derivative" text="d\omega" >}}.

## Examples
1. **Left-invariant forms on a Lie group.** For $M=G$ with the left translation action, any left-invariant 1-form (and its wedge products) is $G$-invariant.
2. **Volume on the sphere.** The standard volume form on $S^n$ is invariant under the natural $SO(n+1)$-action.
3. **Basic forms are invariant.** Any {{< knowl id="basic-differential-form-on-a-principal-bundle" text="basic form" >}} on a principal bundle is invariant under the principal right action by definition.
