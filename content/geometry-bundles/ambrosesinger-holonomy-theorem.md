Let $M$ be a connected {{< knowl id="smooth-manifold" text="smooth manifold" >}} and let $\pi:P\to M$ be a {{< knowl id="principal-g-bundle" text="principal G-bundle" >}} with structure group a {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}} $G$. Fix a {{< knowl id="principal-connection" text="principal connection" >}} $\omega$ on $P$ with curvature form $\Omega$.

For $x\in M$ and $p\in P_x$, let $\mathrm{Hol}_p(\omega)\subseteq G$ denote the {{< knowl id="holonomy-group" text="holonomy group" >}} based at $p$, and let $\mathrm{Hol}^0_p(\omega)$ be its identity component. Write
\[
\mathfrak{hol}_p(\omega):=\mathrm{Lie}\bigl(\mathrm{Hol}^0_p(\omega)\bigr),
\]
the corresponding {{< knowl id="lie-algebra" text="Lie algebra" >}}.

## Theorem (Ambrose–Singer)

Let $p\in P_x$. Consider all points $q\in P$ that can be reached from $p$ by a piecewise smooth horizontal curve (equivalently, by {{< knowl id="parallel-transport" text="parallel transport" >}} from $x$ along some curve in $M$). For each such $q$, and for each pair of tangent vectors $U,V\in T_{\pi(q)}M$, choose their horizontal lifts $U^h,V^h\in T_qP$.

Then $\mathfrak{hol}_p(\omega)$ is the smallest Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$ containing all elements
\[
\Omega_q(U^h,V^h)\in\mathfrak{g}
\]
as $q,U,V$ vary as above. Equivalently, $\mathfrak{hol}_p(\omega)$ is generated (as a Lie algebra) by the curvature values “seen” along horizontal transport from the basepoint.

A common equivalent formulation uses an associated vector bundle: for any associated bundle $E=P\times_G V$ with its induced {{< knowl id="connection-on-a-vector-bundle" text="connection on a vector bundle" >}} $\nabla$, the holonomy Lie algebra at $x$ is generated by endomorphisms obtained by transporting curvature operators back to $x$:
\[
\mathrm{span\;Lie}\left\{ \mathrm{PT}_{\gamma}^{-1}\circ R_y(u,v)\circ \mathrm{PT}_{\gamma} \right\},
\]
where $y\in M$, $u,v\in T_yM$, and $\mathrm{PT}_\gamma$ is parallel transport along a curve $\gamma$ from $x$ to $y$; here $R$ denotes the {{< knowl id="curvature" text="curvature" >}} of $\nabla$.

## Examples

1. **Flat connections have zero holonomy Lie algebra.**  
   If $\Omega=0$, then the generating set above is empty, so $\mathfrak{hol}_p(\omega)=\{0\}$. Thus the restricted holonomy group is trivial; any remaining holonomy comes from monodromy of the base’s fundamental group.

2. **Round sphere has full orthogonal holonomy (Levi-Civita).**  
   For the Levi-Civita connection on the tangent bundle of the round $n$-sphere ($n\ge2$), curvature at a point spans $\mathfrak{so}(n)$ (in orthonormal frames). By Ambrose–Singer, the restricted holonomy Lie algebra is $\mathfrak{so}(n)$, hence the restricted holonomy group is $\mathrm{SO}(n)$.

3. **Direct sums/products give direct-sum holonomy algebras.**  
   For a direct-sum connection on a bundle $E=E_1\oplus E_2$ (or a product connection on a product manifold), the curvature is block-diagonal, so the generated holonomy Lie algebra is (at most) a direct sum of the holonomy Lie algebras of the factors.
