description: "A connection whose curvature is a critical point of the Yang–Mills functional, equivalently satisfying the Yang–Mills equation."

Let $P\to M$ be a principal $G$-bundle over an oriented Riemannian manifold.

## Definition (Yang–Mills connection)
A {{< knowl id="principal-connection" text="principal connection" >}} $A$ on $P$ is called a **Yang–Mills connection** if it satisfies the {{< knowl id="yangmills-equation" text="Yang–Mills equation" >}}
\[
d_A(*F_A)=0,
\]
where $F_A$ is its {{< knowl id="curvature" text="curvature" >}}.

Equivalently, $A$ is a Yang–Mills connection if it is a critical point of the {{< knowl id="yangmills-functional" text="Yang–Mills functional" >}} with respect to compactly supported variations.

## Examples
1. **Flat connections.** Any flat connection is Yang–Mills, since its curvature vanishes.
2. **Anti-self-dual connections.** On an oriented 4-manifold, ASD (or SD) connections are Yang–Mills; these are the basic instanton solutions in gauge theory.
3. **Constant central curvature on surfaces.** On a closed oriented surface, Yang–Mills connections are precisely those whose curvature is covariantly constant and takes values in the center of the Lie algebra (a two-dimensional special feature).
