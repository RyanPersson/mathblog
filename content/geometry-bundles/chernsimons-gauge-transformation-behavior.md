title: "Gauge transformation behavior of Chern–Simons forms"
description: "Under a gauge transformation, a Chern–Simons form changes by an exact term plus a group term, yielding a functional well-defined modulo integers in integral normalizations."
---

Let $\pi:P\to M$ be a {{< knowl id="principal-g-bundle" text="principal G-bundle" >}} with structure group a {{< knowl id="lie-group" text="Lie group" >}} $G$, and let $A$ be a {{< knowl id="principal-connection" text="principal connection" >}} on $P$ with {{< knowl id="curvature" text="curvature" >}} $F_A$. Fix an $\mathrm{Ad}$-invariant homogeneous polynomial $P$ of degree $k$ on the {{< knowl id="lie-algebra" text="Lie algebra" >}} $\mathfrak{g}$.

## Statement (name-level, with standard formula)

There is a canonical Chern–Simons $(2k-1)$-form $\mathrm{CS}_P(A)$ on $M$ (defined locally from $A$) satisfying
\[
d\,\mathrm{CS}_P(A)=P(F_A),
\]
where $d$ is the {{< knowl id="exterior-derivative" text="exterior derivative" >}}.

Under a gauge transformation $g$ (locally, a smooth map $g:U\to G$ in a trivialization), the transformed connection is
\[
A^g = g^{-1}Ag + g^{-1}dg,
\]
and the Chern–Simons form changes by a universal transgression formula of the form
\[
\mathrm{CS}_P(A^g)-\mathrm{CS}_P(A) \;=\; d\,\alpha_P(A,g)\;+\; g^*\eta_P,
\]
where:
- $\alpha_P(A,g)$ is an explicit $(2k-2)$-form built from $A$ and $g^{-1}dg$, and
- $\eta_P$ is a closed $(2k-1)$-form on $G$ determined by $P$ (the “group term”), expressed using the {{< knowl id="lie-bracket" text="Lie bracket" >}} and wedge products on $\mathfrak{g}$-valued forms.

Consequences on closed manifolds: if $P$ corresponds (via Chern–Weil theory) to an integral characteristic class, then for every closed oriented $(2k-1)$-manifold $M$ the number
\[
\int_M \mathrm{CS}_P(A)
\]
is invariant under gauge transformations modulo integers (with the conventional $2\pi$-normalization built into $P$).

## Examples

1. **Abelian case $G=\mathrm{U}(1)$ (degree $k=1$).**  
   Here $A$ is an ordinary real $1$-form (in a trivialization) and gauge transformations act by $A\mapsto A + d\phi$ for a circle-valued function. The Chern–Simons “form” is just $A$, and its change is exact, so the integral over a closed loop depends only on the winding of the gauge function.

2. **Three-dimensional Chern–Simons for $k=2$.**  
   When $k=2$ (so $\mathrm{CS}_P$ is a $3$-form), the group term is the classical $3$-form on $G$ built from $g^{-1}dg$. In particular, on a trivial bundle with $A=0$ one has
   \[
   \mathrm{CS}_P(A^g)=g^*\eta_P,
   \]
   and the integral over a closed $3$-manifold measures the homotopy class of $g$ (an integer for integral normalizations).

3. **Gauge invariance modulo integers of the Chern–Simons functional.**  
   For compact $G$ and integral $P$, the Chern–Simons functional on a closed $(2k-1)$-manifold is a well-defined element of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$; different representatives differ by an integer coming from the group term.
