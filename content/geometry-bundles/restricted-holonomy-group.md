title: "Restricted holonomy group"
description: "The identity-component holonomy generated by parallel transport around contractible loops."

Let \(\pi:P\to M\) be a principal \(G\)-bundle with connection, and let \(\mathrm{Hol}_p\) be the {{< knowl id="holonomy-group" text="holonomy group" >}} at \(p\in P\).

The **restricted holonomy group at \(p\)**, denoted \(\mathrm{Hol}_p^0\), is the subgroup of \(\mathrm{Hol}_p\) generated by parallel transport around loops \(\gamma\) based at \(x=\pi(p)\) that are **contractible** in \(M\).

If \(M\) is a connected {{< knowl id="smooth-manifold" text="smooth manifold" >}}, then \(\mathrm{Hol}_p^0\) is a connected Lie subgroup of \(G\), and it coincides with the identity component of \(\mathrm{Hol}_p\). As with full holonomy, changing \(p\) within the fiber conjugates \(\mathrm{Hol}_p^0\).

## Examples
1. **Simply connected base.** If \(M\) is simply connected, every loop is contractible, hence \(\mathrm{Hol}_p^0=\mathrm{Hol}_p\).

2. **Flat connections.** For a {{< knowl id="flat-principal-connection" text="flat principal connection" >}}, holonomy depends only on the homotopy class of the loop. Contractible loops represent the identity element of \(\pi_1(M)\), so \(\mathrm{Hol}_p^0=\{e\}\), while \(\mathrm{Hol}_p\) may still be nontrivial if \(\pi_1(M)\) is nontrivial.

3. **Discrete structure group.** If \(G\) is discrete (e.g. \(G=O(1)=\{\pm1\}\)), then the identity component of any subgroup is trivial. Thus \(\mathrm{Hol}_p^0=\{e\}\) always, even when \(\mathrm{Hol}_p\) is nontrivial.
