title: "Convention: associated bundles use a left action on the fiber"
description: "Convention for forming an associated bundle from a right principal action and a left action on the typical fiber"
---

Associated bundles combine the right principal action on a {{< knowl id="principal-g-bundle" text="principal bundle" >}} with a left action on the model fiber.

## Convention
Let $\pi:P\to M$ be a principal $G$-bundle equipped with the right action $P\times G\to P$, $(p,g)\mapsto p\cdot g$ (see {{< knowl id="convention-principal-bundles-use-a-right-g-action-on-p" text="right action convention" >}}). Let $F$ be a smooth left $G$-space, i.e. a manifold with a smooth action $G\times F\to F$, $(g,f)\mapsto g\cdot f$ (compare {{< knowl id="smooth-action-of-a-lie-group-on-a-manifold" text="smooth group action" >}}).

We define the **associated bundle**
\[
P\times_G F
\]
to be the quotient of $P\times F$ by the equivalence relation
\[
(p\cdot g,\ f)\sim (p,\ g\cdot f).
\]
We denote the equivalence class of $(p,f)$ by $[p,f]$. The projection
\[
[p,f]\longmapsto \pi(p)
\]
is well-defined and makes $P\times_G F\to M$ into a {{< knowl id="associated-bundle" text="fiber bundle associated to P" >}}. This is the convention used in {{< knowl id="construction-associated-bundle-p-g-f-from-a-left-g-space-f" text="the associated bundle construction" >}}.

A useful bookkeeping consequence is the following: if local sections $s_i:U_i\to P$ define transition functions by $s_j=s_i\,g_{ij}$ (as in {{< knowl id="construction-transition-functions-g-iju-iu-jg-from-local-sections" text="transition functions from local sections" >}}), then the induced local trivializations satisfy
\[
[s_j(x),f]=[s_i(x),\,g_{ij}(x)\cdot f],
\]
so the same $g_{ij}$ acts on the fiber by the given left action.

## Examples
1. **Associated vector bundle from a representation.**  
   If $\rho:G\to GL(V)$ is a {{< knowl id="representation-of-a-lie-group" text="representation" >}}, then $V$ is a left $G$-space via $g\cdot v:=\rho(g)v$, and $P\times_G V$ is an {{< knowl id="associated-vector-bundle" text="associated vector bundle" >}}.

2. **Recovering a vector bundle from its frame bundle.**  
   For a rank $n$ vector bundle $E\to M$ with frame bundle $P=\operatorname{Fr}(E)$, take $F=\mathbb R^n$ with the standard left $GL(n)$-action. Then
   \[
   \operatorname{Fr}(E)\times_{GL(n)}\mathbb R^n \cong E
   \]
   canonically (this is the basic example behind {{< knowl id="tfae-vector-bundle-connections-via-frame-bundles-rank-n-vector-bundle-em" text="frame-bundle descriptions of vector-bundle data" >}}).

3. **Hopf bundle and the Hopf line bundle.**  
   For the {{< knowl id="hopf-fibration-s3s2-as-a-principal-u-bundle" text="Hopf fibration" >}} $S^3\to S^2$ (a principal $U(1)$-bundle) and $F=\mathbb C$ with the usual left $U(1)$-action by scalar multiplication, the associated bundle $S^3\times_{U(1)}\mathbb C\to S^2$ is the standard nontrivial {{< knowl id="complex-vector-bundle" text="complex line bundle" >}} over $S^2$.
