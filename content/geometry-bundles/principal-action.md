title: "Principal action"
description: "A smooth action that is both free and proper."
---

Let $G$ act smoothly on a manifold $M$.

## Definition
A **principal action** is an action that is simultaneously a {{< knowl id="free-action" text="free action" >}} and a {{< knowl id="proper-action" text="proper action" >}}.

Equivalently, a principal action is precisely the hypothesis under which the orbit space carries a canonical smooth structure making the projection $M\to M/G$ into a {{< knowl id="principal-g-bundle" text="principal G-bundle" >}} (see {{< knowl id="quotient-manifold" text="quotient manifold" >}}).

## Examples
1. **The defining action of a principal bundle.** If $\pi:P\to B$ is a principal $G$-bundle, then the right $G$-action on $P$ is principal.
2. **Integer translations.** $\mathbb{Z}$ acts on $\mathbb{R}$ by $n\cdot x=x+n$; the action is free and proper, hence principal.
3. **Hopf action.** The standard $S^1$-action on $S^{2n+1}\subset\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ by scalar multiplication is principal; the quotient is complex projective space.
