title: "Cartan's second structure equation (curvature) in the frame bundle"
description: "On the frame bundle, the curvature form is given by d omega plus one half the bracket of omega with itself."

Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional {{< knowl id="smooth-manifold" text="smooth manifold" >}} and let $\pi:F(M)\to M$ be its frame bundle, a {{< knowl id="principal-g-bundle" text="principal G-bundle" >}} with structure group $G=\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$. Fix a {{< knowl id="principal-connection" text="principal connection" >}} $\omega\in\Omega^1(F(M);\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R}))$, where $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R})$ is the {{< knowl id="lie-algebra" text="Lie algebra" >}} of $G$.

## Statement (frame bundle formulation)

The {{< knowl id="curvature" text="curvature" >}} of $\omega$ is the $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R})$-valued $2$-form $\Omega\in\Omega^2(F(M);\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R}))$ defined by
\[
\Omega \;:=\; d\omega \;+\;\tfrac12[\omega\wedge\omega].
\]

This identity is **Cartan’s second structure equation**, where $d$ is the {{< knowl id="exterior-derivative" text="exterior derivative" >}} and the bracket wedge is defined by
\[
[\omega\wedge\omega](V,W)\;=\;[\omega(V),\omega(W)],
\]
using the {{< knowl id="lie-bracket" text="Lie bracket" >}} on $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R})$.

The form $\Omega$ is horizontal and $G$-equivariant. Under the usual correspondence between principal connections on $F(M)$ and linear connections on $TM$, $\Omega$ encodes the Riemann curvature tensor of the induced connection on the {{< knowl id="tangent-bundle" text="tangent bundle" >}}.

## Examples

1. **Flat connection in a global frame.**  
   If $M=\mathbb{R}^n$ with its standard frame and $\omega=0$, then $\Omega=0$ by the second structure equation.

2. **Constant sectional curvature model.**  
   For the round sphere with its Levi-Civita connection, in a local orthonormal coframe one has curvature $2$-forms of the schematic shape
   \[
   \Omega^i{}_j = K\,\theta^i\wedge\theta^j,
   \]
   reflecting constant sectional curvature $K>0$.

3. **Product connections.**  
   If $M=M_1\times M_2$ and the connection on $TM\cong TM_1\oplus TM_2$ is the product of connections on the factors, then $\Omega$ is block-diagonal with blocks given by the curvature forms from each factor, and there are no mixed curvature terms.
