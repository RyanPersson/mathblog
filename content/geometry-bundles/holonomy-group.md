title: "Holonomy group"
description: "The subgroup of the structure group obtained by parallel transport around loops based at a point."

Let \(\pi:P\to M\) be a principal \(G\)-bundle equipped with a {{< knowl id="principal-connection" text="principal connection" >}}. Fix a point \(p\in P\) and set \(x=\pi(p)\in M\).

For a piecewise smooth loop \(\gamma:[0,1]\to M\) with \(\gamma(0)=\gamma(1)=x\), let \(\widetilde\gamma:[0,1]\to P\) be the horizontal lift starting at \(p\) (i.e. \(\widetilde\gamma(0)=p\) and \(\dot{\widetilde\gamma}(t)\in H_{\widetilde\gamma(t)}\) for all \(t\)). Since \(\widetilde\gamma(1)\) lies in the same fiber as \(p\), there is a unique \(g_\gamma\in G\) such that
\[
\widetilde\gamma(1)=p\cdot g_\gamma.
\]

The **holonomy group at \(p\)** is
\[
\mathrm{Hol}_p \coloneqq \{\, g_\gamma \in G \mid \gamma \text{ is a loop based at } x \,\}\;\subset\;  G.
\]
Equivalently, \(\mathrm{Hol}_p\) is the subgroup generated by all {{< knowl id="parallel-transport" text="parallel transports" >}} along loops based at \(x\).

If \(p' = p\cdot h\) is another point in the same fiber, then \(\mathrm{Hol}_{p'} = h^{-1}\mathrm{Hol}_p\,h\); thus the holonomy group is well-defined up to conjugacy inside \(G\).

## Examples
1. **Trivial flat connection.** On \(M\times G\) with the flat product connection, horizontal lifts keep the \(G\)-coordinate constant, so \(\mathrm{Hol}_p=\{e\}\).

2. **Flat connection over \(S^1\).** For a flat connection on a bundle over \(S^1\), parallel transport around the fundamental loop yields an element \(h\in G\); the holonomy group is the subgroup generated by \(h\) (and is therefore cyclic if \(G\) is discrete, or may be a torus-type subgroup in a compact Lie group).

3. **Hopf fibration.** For the standard connection on the Hopf bundle \(S^3\to S^2\) with structure group \(U(1)\), holonomy around loops in \(S^2\) produces arbitrary phases, so \(\mathrm{Hol}_p = U(1)\).
