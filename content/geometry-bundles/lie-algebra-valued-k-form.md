description: "A differential form whose values lie in a fixed Lie algebra."

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let {{< knowl id="lie-algebra" text="Lie algebra" >}} $\mathfrak{g}$ be fixed.

## Definition
A **$\mathfrak{g}$-valued differential k-form** on $M$ is a smooth section of the vector bundle
\[
\Lambda^k T^*M \otimes \mathfrak{g} \;\longrightarrow\; M.
\]
Equivalently, it is a smoothly varying alternating multilinear map
\[
\alpha_x : (T_xM)^k \to \mathfrak{g}
\quad\text{for each }x\in M.
\]
The space of such forms is commonly denoted $\Omega^k(M;\mathfrak{g})$.

Concretely, choosing a basis $\{e_a\}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$, any $\alpha\in\Omega^k(M;\mathfrak{g})$ can be written uniquely as
\[
\alpha = \sum_a \alpha^a \, e_a,
\]
with ordinary $k$-forms $\alpha^a\in\Omega^k(M)$.

## Examples
1. **Maurer–Cartan form.** On a Lie group $G$, the left Maurer–Cartan form is a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-form on $G$.
2. **Connection form.** A {{< knowl id="principal-connection" text="principal connection" >}} on a principal bundle is encoded by a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-form on the total space (the connection form).
3. **Curvature.** The {{< knowl id="curvature" text="curvature" >}} of a principal connection is a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 2-form on the total space.
