A **set** is an object $A$ for which it makes sense to ask, for any object $x$, whether $x \in A$ ("$x$ is an element of $A$").

In axiomatic set theory (e.g. {{< knowl id="zfc-axioms" text="ZFC" >}}), "set" and the membership relation $\in$ are taken as primitive, and other basic notions—such as {{< knowl id="subset" text="subsets" >}} and the {{< knowl id="empty-set" text="empty set" >}}—are defined using $\in$.

**Examples:**
- $\{1,2,3\}$ is the set whose elements are $1,2,3$.
- $\emptyset$ is the set with no elements.
- $\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of integers.
