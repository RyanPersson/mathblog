title: "Bijective function"
description: "A function that is both injective and surjective"
---

Let $f\colon A\to B$ be a {{< knowl id="function" text="function" >}}. Then $f$ is **bijective** if it is both {{< knowl id="injective-function" text="injective" >}} and {{< knowl id="surjective-function" text="surjective" >}}.

Equivalently, $f$ is bijective if and only if it has an {{< knowl id="inverse-function" text="inverse function" >}}.

**Examples:**
- $f\colon\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}$ given by $f(n)=n+1$ is bijective.
- The map $g\colon\mathbb{R}\to(0,\infty)$ given by $g(x)=e^x$ is bijective.
- The map $h\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, $h(x)=x^2$, is not bijective.
