description: "Every family of nonempty sets admits a choice function selecting one element from each set"

The **axiom of choice (AC)** states:

For every indexed family $(A_i)_{i\in I}$ of nonempty {{< knowl id="set" text="sets" >}}, there exists a {{< knowl id="function" text="function" >}} $c\colon I\to \bigcup_{i\in I} A_i$ (see {{< knowl id="union" text="union" >}}) such that $c(i)\in A_i$ for every $i\in I$. Such a function $c$ is called a **choice function** for the family.

AC is independent of the other {{< knowl id="zfc-axioms" text="ZFC axioms" >}} (ZF) and is equivalent (over ZF) to several major principles, including {{< knowl id="zorns-lemma" text="Zorn's lemma" >}} and the {{< knowl id="well-ordering-theorem" text="well-ordering theorem" >}}.
