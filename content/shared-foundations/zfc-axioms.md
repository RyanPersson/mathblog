The **Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms with Choice (ZFC)** are a commonly used axiom system for {{< knowl id="set" text="sets" >}} and the membership relation $\in$. ZFC consists of the ZF axioms together with the {{< knowl id="axiom-of-choice" text="axiom of choice" >}}.

A typical presentation includes (informally stated):
- **Extensionality:** sets with the same elements are equal.
- **Empty set:** there exists a set with no elements (the {{< knowl id="empty-set" text="empty set" >}}).
- **Pairing:** for any $a,b$ there is a set containing exactly $a$ and $b$.
- **Union:** for any set $A$, there is a set whose elements are exactly the elements of elements of $A$ (cf. {{< knowl id="union" text="union" >}}).
- **Power set:** for any set $A$, there exists the set of all {{< knowl id="subset" text="subsets" >}} of $A$.
- **Infinity:** there exists an infinite set (supporting the construction of $\mathbb{N}$).
- **Separation schema:** {{< knowl id="subset" text="subsets" >}} defined by a property exist as subsets of an existing set.
- **Replacement schema:** {{< knowl id="image" text="images" >}} of sets under definable {{< knowl id="function" text="functions" >}} are sets.
- **Foundation (Regularity):** every nonempty set has an $\in$-minimal element.

These axioms underlie most of standard mathematics formulated in set-theoretic foundations.
