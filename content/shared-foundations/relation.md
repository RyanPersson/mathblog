title: "Relation"
description: "A subset of a Cartesian product A×B, viewed as a set of ordered pairs"
---

Let $A$ and $B$ be {{< knowl id="set" text="sets" >}}. A **(binary) relation** $R$ from $A$ to $B$ is a {{< knowl id="subset" text="subset" >}} $R \subseteq A\times B$ of the {{< knowl id="cartesian-product" text="Cartesian product" >}}; its elements are {{< knowl id="ordered-pair" text="ordered pairs" >}} $(a,b)$ interpreted as "$a$ is related to $b$."

A relation on a set $A$ means a subset $R \subseteq A\times A$. A {{< knowl id="function" text="function" >}} is a relation with a uniqueness/existence property (each input is related to exactly one output).

**Examples:**
- The usual $\le$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is a relation on $\mathbb{R}$.
- Divisibility on $\mathbb{N}$ is a relation: $a\,R\,b$ means "$a$ divides $b$."
- If $A=\{1,2\}$, then $R=\{(1,1),(1,2)\}\subseteq A\times A$ is a relation on $A$.
