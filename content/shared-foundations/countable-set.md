title: "Countable set"
description: "A set that is finite or can be listed in a sequence; equivalently, injects into ℕ"

A {{< knowl id="set" text="set" >}} $A$ is **countable** if there exists an {{< knowl id="injective-function" text="injective function" >}} $f\colon A\to\mathbb{N}$.

Equivalently, $A$ is countable if it is finite or there exists a {{< knowl id="bijective-function" text="bijection" >}} $f\colon A\to\mathbb{N}$. In terms of {{< knowl id="cardinality" text="cardinality" >}}, this says $|A|\le|\mathbb{N}|$.

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ are countable.
- The set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.
- Any finite set is countable.
