description: "A function *:S×S→S combining two elements of S into one"

Let $S$ be a {{< knowl id="set" text="set" >}}. A **binary operation** on $S$ is a {{< knowl id="function" text="function" >}}
$$
*\colon S\times S \to S,
$$
where $S\times S$ is the {{< knowl id="cartesian-product" text="Cartesian product" >}}. Thus, for each {{< knowl id="ordered-pair" text="pair" >}} $(a,b)\in S\times S$, the value $a*b$ is an element of $S$.

Binary operations are the basic input for algebraic structures (groups, rings, etc.), where one adds axioms such as associativity or commutativity.

**Examples:**
- Addition $+\colon\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}$ is a binary operation.
- Matrix multiplication on the set of $n\times n$ real matrices is a binary operation.
- Subtraction on $\mathbb{N}$ is not a binary operation on $\mathbb{N}$ if $\mathbb{N}$ does not contain negatives (not closed).
