title: "Empty set"
description: "The unique set with no elements, denoted ∅"
---

The **empty set**, denoted $\emptyset$, is the {{< knowl id="set" text="set" >}} with no elements:
$$
\forall x\,(x \notin \emptyset).
$$

In {{< knowl id="zfc-axioms" text="ZFC" >}}, existence of $\emptyset$ is ensured by an axiom; uniqueness follows from extensionality (a set is determined by its elements). The empty set is a {{< knowl id="subset" text="subset" >}} of every set.

**Examples:**
- The solution set to $x^2 + 1 = 0$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is $\emptyset$.
- For any set $A$, $A \cap \emptyset = \emptyset$.
- For any set $A$, $A \cup \emptyset = A$.
