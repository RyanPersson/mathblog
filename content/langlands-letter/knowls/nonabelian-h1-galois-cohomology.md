Let $\Gamma=\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)$ act on $G(K)$ by field automorphisms.

A **1-cocycle** is a map $a:\Gamma\to G(K)$ satisfying
$
a_{\sigma\tau}=a_\sigma\cdot {}^\sigma a_\tau.
$

Two cocycles are **cohomologous** if $a'_\sigma=g^{-1}a_\sigma\,{}^\sigma g$ for some $g\in G(K)$; the set of classes is **nonabelian cohomology** $H^1(\Gamma,G)$ (a pointed set).

**In the letter:** an "inner twisting" is specified by such a cocycle $\{a_\tau\}$, and "splitting locally at almost all $p$" means the restriction class becomes trivial for local decomposition groups.
