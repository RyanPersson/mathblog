title: "Euler Product and Determinant Local $L$-Factor"
description: "An $L$-function defined as $\\prod_p \\det(1-\\pi(\\alpha_p)p^{-s})^{-1}$ at unramified primes"

An **Euler product** is a product over primes (or places) of local factors, typically convergent for $\mathrm{Re}(s)\gg 0$.

In the letter, given a representation $\pi$ of the {{< knowl id="l-group-satake-parameter" section="langlands-letter/knowls" text="$L$-group" >}} and Satake parameters $\alpha_p$, the unramified local factor is
$
L_p(s)=\det\!\bigl(1-\pi(\alpha_p)\,p^{-s}\bigr)^{-1}.
$

The global $L$-function is $L(s)=\prod_p L_p(s)$, with finitely many "bad primes" omitted or modified.

**Key point:** changing auxiliary choices typically changes only finitely many local factors.
