description: "A semisimple group with no nontrivial central isogeny covers (in the sense of algebraic groups)"
---

A **semisimple** algebraic group is a connected reductive group with trivial connected center (equivalently, its root datum has no torus factor).

A **central isogeny** $f:G_1\to G_2$ is a surjective morphism of connected algebraic groups with finite kernel contained in the center of $G_1$.

A semisimple group $G$ is **simply connected** if every central isogeny $H\to G$ is an isomorphism (equivalently, the **cocharacter lattice** $X_*(T)$ equals the **coroot lattice** for a maximal torus $T$).

**In the letter:** $G_e$ is chosen with "simply connected non-abelian factors" so that lattices and duals behave cleanly.
