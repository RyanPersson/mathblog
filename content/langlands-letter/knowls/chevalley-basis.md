title: "Chevalley Basis"
description: "A root-adapted Lie algebra basis with integral structure constants"
---

Let $G$ be split semisimple with Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and split Cartan $\mathfrak t$.

A **Chevalley basis** is a basis of the form $\{H_i\}\cup\{X_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in\Phi}$ where:
- each $X_\alpha$ spans the root space $\mathfrak g_\alpha$,
- the brackets satisfy $[X_\alpha,X_{-\alpha}]=H_\alpha$,
- all structure constants are integers.

**In the letter:** choosing root vectors $X_\alpha$ "satisfying Chevalley conditions" rigidifies automorphisms (the group $\Omega$) and supports integral forms.
