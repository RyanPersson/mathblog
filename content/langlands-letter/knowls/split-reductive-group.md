title: "Split Reductive Algebraic Group"
description: "A connected affine algebraic group with trivial unipotent radical and a split maximal torus"
---

A **(connected) reductive algebraic group** over a field $k$ is a smooth connected affine $k$-group $G$ whose **unipotent radical** $R_u(G)$ (largest connected normal unipotent $k$-subgroup) is trivial.

$G$ is **split over $k$** if it contains a **split maximal torus** $T \simeq \mathbb{G}_m^r$ defined over $k$.

**Key properties (used in the letter):**
- Splitness lets one define roots and weights inside $X^*(T)$ and build the {{< knowl id="langlands-dual-group" section="langlands-letter/knowls" text="Langlands dual group" >}}.
- "Almost all primes $p$" are "good" places where $G$ is unramified and has a canonical hyperspecial compact.

**Example:** $G=\mathrm{GL}_n$ over $k$ is split reductive.
