A **global field** (in this letter) is a number field, i.e. a finite extension $F/\mathbb{Q}$.

A **place** $v$ of $F$ is an equivalence class of absolute values on $F$; it is **archimedean** if it comes from an embedding $F\hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, and **nonarchimedean** otherwise.

The **completion** $F_v$ is the completion of $F$ with respect to $|\cdot|_v$.

A **local field** is a nondiscrete locally compact topological field; examples: $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, and finite extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p$.
