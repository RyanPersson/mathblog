An **$L$-homomorphism** is a group homomorphism $\omega:{}^LG'\to {}^LG$ such that:
- it commutes with the projections to the Galois/Weil groups, and
- its restriction to dual groups is an algebraic homomorphism $\widehat G'\to \widehat G$.

**Functoriality (as used in the letter):**
If $\phi'$ has Satake parameters $\alpha'_p$ for $G'$, then the predicted transfer $\phi$ for $G$ should satisfy (for almost all $p$)
$
\alpha_p \sim \omega(\alpha'_p)
$
as conjugacy classes in ${}^LG$.

This is exactly the letter's "second question," stated in terms of pushing forward $\alpha'_p$.
