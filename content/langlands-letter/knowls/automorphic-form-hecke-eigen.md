title: "Automorphic Form and Hecke Eigenvalues"
description: "A function on $G(F)\\backslash G(\\mathbb{A}_F)$ whose unramified Hecke action yields Satake parameters"

Let $F$ be a number field and $\mathbb{A}_F$ its adele ring; write $G(\mathbb{A}_F)$ for adelic points of $G$.

An **automorphic form** (informally, as in the letter) is a function $\phi$ on $G(F)\backslash G(\mathbb{A}_F)$ on which the spherical Hecke algebras at almost all finite places act by convolution.

Being a **Hecke eigenfunction** at $p$ means there is a homomorphism $\chi_p:\mathcal H(G(F_p),K_p)\to\mathbb{C}$ with $T\phi=\chi_p(T)\phi$ for all $T$.

Via {{< knowl id="spherical-hecke-algebra-satake" section="langlands-letter/knowls" text="Satake" >}}, $\chi_p$ determines the conjugacy class $\alpha_p$ used in the Euler product.

**Example:** Classical modular forms correspond to automorphic forms on $\mathrm{GL}_2$.
