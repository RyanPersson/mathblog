description: "A complete inner product space"

A **Hilbert space** is an {{< knowl id="inner-product-space" text="inner product space" >}} that is **complete** with respect to the {{< knowl id="metric" section="analysis" text="metric" >}} induced by its {{< knowl id="norm" text="norm" >}}.

Equivalently, it is a {{< knowl id="banach-space" text="Banach space" >}} whose norm arises from an {{< knowl id="inner-product" text="inner product" >}}.

**Examples**:
- $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{C}^n$ with the standard inner product
- $L^2$ spaces: $\langle f, g \rangle = \int \overline{f(x)} g(x) \, dx$
- $\ell^2$: sequences $(a_n)$ with $\sum |a_n|^2 < \infty$

Hilbert spaces are central to quantum mechanics and functional analysis.
