title: "Linear Operator"
description: "A linear map from a vector space to itself"
---

A **linear operator** on a {{< knowl id="vector-space" text="vector space" >}} $V$ is a {{< knowl id="linear-map" text="linear map" >}} $T:V\to V$.

Linear operators are the basic input for spectral notions such as {{< knowl id="eigenvalue" text="eigenvalues" >}} and eigenvectors, and for polynomial invariants like characteristic and minimal polynomials.

**Examples:**
- The identity operator $I:V\to V$ given by $I(v)=v$ is linear.
- The zero operator $0:V\to V$ given by $0(v)=0$ is linear.
- On $\mathbb{R}^2$, the map $T(x,y)=(x,0)$ is a linear operator (projection onto the $x$-axis).
