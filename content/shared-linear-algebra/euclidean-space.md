For $k\in\mathbb{N}$, **Euclidean space** $\mathbb{R}^k$ is the set of all $k$-tuples $(x_1,\dots,x_k)$ with $x_i\in\mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the {{< knowl id="real-numbers" text="real numbers" >}}. Equivalently, $\mathbb{R}^k$ is the $k$-fold {{< knowl id="cartesian-product" text="Cartesian product" >}} of $\mathbb{R}$ with itself.

With coordinatewise addition and scalar multiplication by $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R}^k$ is a {{< knowl id="vector-space" text="vector space" >}}. It carries a standard {{< knowl id="inner-product" text="inner product" >}} and the associated {{< knowl id="euclidean-norm" text="Euclidean norm" >}}.

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb{R}^1$ is (canonically) identified with the real line.
- $\mathbb{R}^2$ models the Euclidean plane; points and vectors can both be represented as ordered pairs.
- $\mathbb{R}^3$ models ordinary 3-dimensional space with coordinates $(x,y,z)$.
