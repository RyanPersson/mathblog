title: "Simple ring"
description: "A ring with no nontrivial two-sided ideals."

A **simple ring** is a {{</* knowl id="ring" text="ring" */>}} $R$ such that its only {{</* knowl id="two-sided-ideal" text="two-sided ideals" */>}} are $0$ and $R$ itself.

Simple rings are the “atoms” of ring theory: if $I$ is a nonzero two-sided ideal, then $R/I$ is a nontrivial {{</* knowl id="quotient-ring" text="quotient ring" */>}}, so simplicity rules out all proper quotients. Standard families of examples are {{</* knowl id="division-ring" text="division rings" */>}} and {{</* knowl id="matrix-ring" text="matrix rings" */>} over them.

**Examples:**
- If $D$ is a division ring, then $D$ is simple.
- For a division ring $D$ and $n\ge 1$, the ring $M_n(D)$ is simple.
- $\mathbb{Z}$ is not simple since $(2)$ is a nontrivial two-sided ideal.
