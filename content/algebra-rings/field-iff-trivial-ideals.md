**Fields and trivial ideals**: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1$. Then $R$ is a field if and only if the only ideals of $R$ are $(0)$ and $R$. Equivalently, every nonzero element of $R$ is a unit.

This criterion characterizes {{</* knowl id="field" text="fields" */>}} among {{</* knowl id="commutative-ring" text="commutative rings" */>}} via the lattice of {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideals" */>}}; the forward direction uses that nonzero elements are {{</* knowl id="unit" text="units" */>}}, and the reverse direction shows every nonzero principal ideal must be the whole ring. It is often paired with {{</* knowl id="maximal-iff-quotient-field" text="maximal iff quotient is a field" */>}} to analyze {{</* knowl id="maximal-ideal" text="maximal ideals" */>}}.
