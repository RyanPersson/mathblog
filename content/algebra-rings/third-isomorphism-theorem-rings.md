**Third isomorphism theorem (rings)**: Let \(R\) be a ring and let \(I\subseteq J\) be {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideals" */>} of \(R\). Then \(J/I\) is an ideal of \(R/I\), and there is a natural {{</* knowl id="ring-isomorphism" text="ring isomorphism" */>}}
\[
(R/I)/(J/I)\ \cong\ R/J
\]
of {{</* knowl id="quotient-ring" text="quotient rings" */>}.

This formalizes the idea that “modding out in stages” is equivalent to modding out by the total relation.
