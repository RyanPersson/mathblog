title: "Unit"
description: "An element of a unital ring that has a multiplicative inverse."

Let $R$ be a {{</* knowl id="unital-ring" text="unital ring" */>}}. An element $u\in R$ is a **unit** if there exists $v\in R$ such that $uv=vu=1$.

Units control invertibility of scalars in algebraic constructions and determine the {{</* knowl id="group-of-units" text="group of units" */>}}. In commutative rings, units are precisely the elements that generate the whole ring as a principal ideal.

**Examples:**
- The units of $\mathbb Z$ are $\pm 1$.
- In a field $k$, every nonzero element is a unit.
- In $\mathbb Z$, the element $2$ is not a unit.
