title: "Prime ring"
description: "A ring in which the product of nonzero ideals is never zero."

A **prime ring** is a {{</* knowl id="ring" text="ring" */>}} $R$ such that for any nonzero {{</* knowl id="two-sided-ideal" text="two-sided ideals" */>}} $A,B\subseteq R$, one has $AB\neq 0$, where $AB$ denotes the {{</* knowl id="product-of-ideals" text="product of ideals" */>}}. Equivalently: if $A$ and $B$ are ideals with $AB=0$, then $A=0$ or $B=0$.

In the commutative case, primeness is closely related to being an {{</* knowl id="integral-domain" text="integral domain" */>}}: if $R$ is commutative (and $1\neq 0$), the “ideal” condition forces $ab=0$ to imply $a=0$ or $b=0$.

**Examples:**
- If $D$ is a division ring and $n\ge 1$, then $M_n(D)$ is a prime ring.
- Any integral domain is a prime ring (commutative case).
- A direct product $R_1\times R_2$ with $R_1,R_2\neq 0$ is not prime: $(R_1\times 0)(0\times R_2)=0$.
