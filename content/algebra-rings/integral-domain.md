An **integral domain** is a {{</* knowl id="commutative-ring" text="commutative ring" */>}} with $1\neq 0$ such that for all $a,b\in R$, $ab=0$ implies $a=0$ or $b=0$ (equivalently, $R$ has no {{</* knowl id="zero-divisor" text="zero divisors" */>}}).

Integral domains are the natural setting for divisibility and factorization, and every {{</* knowl id="field" text="field" */>}} is an integral domain. Many constructions (e.g. forming the {{</* knowl id="fraction-field" text="field of fractions" */>}}) require the domain hypothesis.

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain.
- If $k$ is a field, then $k[x]$ is an integral domain.
- $\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$ is not an integral domain since $2\cdot 3=0$ in the quotient.
