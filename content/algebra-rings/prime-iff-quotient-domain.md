**Prime ideal iff quotient is integral domain**: Let \(R\) be a commutative ring with \(1\), and let \(P\triangleleft R\) be an {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" */>}}. Then \(P\) is a {{</* knowl id="prime-ideal" text="prime ideal" */>} if and only if the {{</* knowl id="quotient-ring" text="quotient ring" */>}} \(R/P\) is an {{</* knowl id="integral-domain" text="integral domain" */>}.

This is the fundamental translation between multiplicative primeness and “domain-like” behavior after quotienting.
