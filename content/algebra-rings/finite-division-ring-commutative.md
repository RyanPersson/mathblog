**Finite division rings are commutative**: Every finite division ring is commutative; equivalently, every finite division ring is a field.

This is the standard corollary of {{</* knowl id="wedderburns-little-theorem" text="Wedderburn's little theorem" */>}}, which asserts that any finite {{</* knowl id="division-ring" text="division ring" */>}} has commutative multiplication. Thus a finite division ring is a {{</* knowl id="field" text="field" */>}}.
