description: "A commutative ring with no nonzero nilpotent elements."

A **reduced ring** is a {{</* knowl id="commutative-ring" text="commutative ring" */>}} $R$ such that the only {{</* knowl id="nilpotent-element" text="nilpotent element" */>}} of $R$ is $0$.

Equivalently, $R$ is reduced iff its {{</* knowl id="nilradical" text="nilradical" */>}} is $0$. Reducedness is a basic “no infinitesimals” condition in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb Z$ and $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ are reduced.
- $k[x]/(x^2)$ is not reduced (the class of $x$ is nilpotent).
- Any finite product of reduced rings is reduced.
