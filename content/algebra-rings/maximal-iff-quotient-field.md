**Maximal ideal iff quotient is field**: Let \(R\) be a commutative ring with \(1\), and let \(I\triangleleft R\) be an {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" */>}}. Then \(I\) is a {{</* knowl id="maximal-ideal" text="maximal ideal" */>} if and only if the {{</* knowl id="quotient-ring" text="quotient ring" */>}} \(R/I\) is a {{</* knowl id="field" text="field" */>}.

This equivalence is the main bridge between ideal-theoretic maximality and “no nontrivial quotients” in commutative algebra.
