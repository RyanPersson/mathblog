Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1$, and let $f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i\in R[x]$. The **content** of $f$ is the {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" */>}}
\[
c(f)=(a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n),
\]
i.e. the {{</* knowl id="ideal-generated" text="ideal generated" */>}} by the coefficients of $f$.

When $R$ is a gcd domain (e.g. a {{</* knowl id="ufd" text="UFD" */>}}), the content corresponds (up to {{</* knowl id="associated-elements" text="associates" */>}}) to the {{</* knowl id="gcd" text="gcd" */>}} of the coefficients. The notion is central to Gauss-type results about how factorization in $R[x]$ relates to factorization in $\mathrm{Frac}(R)[x]$.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, for $f=6x^2+15x$ one has $c(f)=(3)$.
- In $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, for $g=x^2+2$ one has $c(g)=(1)$.
- For the zero polynomial $0\in R[x]$, $c(0)=(0)$.
