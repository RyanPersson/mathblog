A **division ring** (or skew field) is a {{</* knowl id="unital-ring" text="unital ring" */>}} $D$ with $1\neq 0$ such that every nonzero element of $D$ is a {{</* knowl id="unit" text="unit" */>}} (equivalently, $D^\times=D\setminus\{0\}$ is a group under multiplication, i.e. the {{</* knowl id="group-of-units" text="group of units" */>}} equals all nonzero elements).

A {{</* knowl id="field" text="field" */>}} is exactly a commutative division ring. Division rings occur as coefficients in noncommutative structure theorems, e.g. in the description of {{</* knowl id="simple-ring" text="simple rings" */>}.

**Examples:**
- The Hamilton quaternions $\mathbb{H}$ form a division ring (noncommutative).
- Any field (e.g. $\mathbb{Q}$) is a division ring.
- The matrix ring $M_n(k)$ for $n\ge 2$ is not a division ring since nonzero singular matrices have no inverse.
