**PID ⇒ UFD**: If \(R\) is a {{</* knowl id="pid" text="principal ideal domain" */>}}, then \(R\) is a {{</* knowl id="ufd" text="unique factorization domain" */>}.

A key step is that in a PID every {{</* knowl id="irreducible-element" text="irreducible element" */>} is {{</* knowl id="prime-element" text="prime" */>}}, because \((p)\) is maximal among proper principal ideals containing \(p\). Existence of factorizations follows from the ascending chain condition on principal ideals.
