**Maximal ideals are prime**: Let \(R\) be a {{</* knowl id="commutative-ring" text="commutative ring" */>}} with \(1\), and let \(\mathfrak m\) be a {{</* knowl id="maximal-ideal" text="maximal ideal" */>}} of \(R\). Then \(\mathfrak m\) is a {{</* knowl id="prime-ideal" text="prime ideal" */>}.

A standard proof uses the characterization that \(R/\mathfrak m\) is a field and hence an integral domain, and translates the domain property back to primeness via the {{</* knowl id="quotient-ring" text="quotient ring" */>}}.
