title: "Nil ideal"
description: "An ideal all of whose elements are nilpotent."

A **nil ideal** in a ring $R$ is an {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" */>}} $I\subseteq R$ such that every element of $I$ is a {{</* knowl id="nilpotent-element" text="nilpotent element" */>}}.

Nil ideals measure the “nilpotent part” of a ring and are always contained in the {{</* knowl id="nilradical" text="nilradical" */>}} in the commutative case. They appear naturally as radicals of Artinian local rings and as Jacobson radical components in finite-dimensional algebras.

**Examples:**
- In $k[x]/(x^n)$, the ideal generated by the class of $x$ is a nil ideal.
- In the ring of upper triangular $n\times n$ matrices over a field, strictly upper triangular matrices form a nil ideal.
- The zero ideal $\{0\}$ is nil in every ring.
