The **unital ring axiom** asserts that a ring \(R\) has an element \(1\in R\) such that
\[
1\cdot a=a\cdot 1=a\qquad\text{for all }a\in R.
\]

A {{</* knowl id="unital-ring" text="unital ring" */>}} is a {{</* knowl id="ring" text="ring" */>}} satisfying this axiom. The presence of \(1\) allows one to define {{</* knowl id="unit" text="units" */>}} (and hence the {{</* knowl id="group-of-units" text="group of units" */>}}) and is typically assumed when discussing standard constructions such as polynomial rings and quotients.
