title: "Intersection of ideals"
description: "The set-theoretic intersection of two ideals, which is again an ideal."

Given ideals $I,J$ in a {{</* knowl id="ring" text="ring" */>}} $R$, their **intersection** is the set-theoretic {{</* knowl id="intersection" text="intersection" */>}} $I\cap J=\{x\in R:x\in I\text{ and }x\in J\}$.

The intersection $I\cap J$ is again an {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" */>}}, and it is the largest ideal contained in both $I$ and $J$. Intersections appear naturally in primary decomposition and in comparing congruence conditions.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb Z$, $(m)\cap (n)=(\operatorname{lcm}(m,n))$, where $\operatorname{lcm}$ is the {{</* knowl id="lcm" text="lcm" */>}}.
- In $k[x,y]$, $(x)\cap (y)=(xy)$.
- If $I\subseteq J$, then $I\cap J=I$.
