A **unital ring** is a {{</* knowl id="ring" text="ring" */>}} $R$ together with an element $1\in R$ such that $1a=a1=a$ for all $a\in R$.

In a unital ring, elements that admit multiplicative inverses are {{</* knowl id="unit" text="units" */>}}, and they form the {{</* knowl id="group-of-units" text="group of units" */>}}. Many constructions (e.g. polynomial rings) and many definitions of {{</* knowl id="ring-homomorphism" text="ring homomorphisms" */>}} are most natural in the unital setting.

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb Z$ is unital with identity $1$.
- $M_n(R)$ is unital for any unital ring $R$, with identity matrix $I_n$.
- $2\mathbb Z$ is a ring but not unital (its inherited multiplication has no identity element).
