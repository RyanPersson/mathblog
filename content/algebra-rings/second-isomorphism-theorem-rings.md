**Second isomorphism theorem (rings)**: Let \(R\) be a ring, let \(A\subseteq R\) be a {{</* knowl id="subring" text="subring" */>}}, and let \(I\triangleleft R\) be an {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" */>}}. Then \(A\cap I\triangleleft A\), \(A+I:=\{a+i:a\in A,\ i\in I\}\) is a subring of \(R\), and there is a natural isomorphism
\[
A/(A\cap I)\ \cong\ (A+I)/I
\]
of {{</* knowl id="quotient-ring" text="quotient rings" */>}.

This is most efficiently proved by restricting the quotient map \(R\to R/I\) to \(A\) and applying the {{</* knowl id="first-isomorphism-theorem-rings" text="first isomorphism theorem" */>}.
