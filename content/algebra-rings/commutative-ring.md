A **commutative ring** is a {{</* knowl id="ring" text="ring" */>}} $R$ such that $ab=ba$ for all $a,b\in R$.

Commutative rings support a particularly rich theory of {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideals" */>}} and spectrum-type constructions; many foundational results are phrased in terms of the {{</* knowl id="commutative-ring-axiom" text="commutative ring axiom" */>}}. In commutative rings, left/right distinctions for ideals and zero divisors disappear.

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb Z$ and $\mathbb Q$ are commutative rings.
- For a field $k$, the polynomial ring $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is commutative.
- $M_n(k)$ for $n\ge 2$ is not commutative (matrix multiplication generally fails to commute).
