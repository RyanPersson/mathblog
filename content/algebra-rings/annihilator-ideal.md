Let $R$ be a ring and let $S\subseteq R$ be a {{</* knowl id="subset" text="subset" */>}}. The **left annihilator** of $S$ is
\[
\operatorname{Ann}_\ell(S)=\{r\in R : rs=0 \text{ for all } s\in S\},
\]
and the **right annihilator** is defined analogously by $sr=0$. In general, $\operatorname{Ann}_\ell(S)$ is a left {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" */>}} and $\operatorname{Ann}_r(S)$ is a right ideal; in commutative rings they coincide.

Annihilators detect torsion and measure how far elements are from being {{</* knowl id="regular-element" text="regular" */>}}: an element is a zero divisor exactly when it has a nontrivial annihilator. They are also central in module theory and duality.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb Z/6\mathbb Z$, the annihilator of the class of $2$ is the ideal generated by the class of $3$.
- In an integral domain, the annihilator of any nonzero element is $\{0\}$.
- In $k[x,y]/(xy)$, the annihilator of the class of $x$ is the ideal generated by the class of $y$.
