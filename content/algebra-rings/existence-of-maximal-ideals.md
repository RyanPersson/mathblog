**Existence of maximal ideals (Zorn)**: Let \(R\) be a {{</* knowl id="unital-ring" text="unital ring" */>}} with \(1\neq 0\), assumed commutative. Then \(R\) has a {{</* knowl id="maximal-ideal" text="maximal ideal" */>}.

This result is typically proved using {{</* knowl id="zorns-lemma" text="Zorn's lemma" */>}} (and hence the {{</* knowl id="axiom-of-choice" text="axiom of choice" */>}}) applied to the partially ordered set of proper {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideals" */>} of \(R\) ordered by inclusion.

**Proof sketch**: Let \(\mathcal{P}\) be the set of proper ideals of \(R\), ordered by inclusion. Any chain \(\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{P}\) has an upper bound \(\bigcup_{J\in\mathcal{C}}J\), which is an ideal and remains proper because \(1\notin J\) for all \(J\in\mathcal{C}\). By Zorn, \(\mathcal{P}\) has a maximal element, which is a maximal ideal.
