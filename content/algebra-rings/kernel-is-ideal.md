**Kernel is an ideal**: Let $\varphi:R\to S$ be a ring homomorphism. Then
\[
\ker(\varphi)=\{r\in R:\varphi(r)=0_S\}
\]
is a two-sided ideal of $R$.

For a {{</* knowl id="ring-homomorphism" text="ring homomorphism" */>}} $\varphi$, the {{</* knowl id="kernel-ring" text="kernel" */>}} is therefore an {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" */>}} (indeed a {{</* knowl id="two-sided-ideal" text="two-sided ideal" */>}} in general), so one can form the {{</* knowl id="quotient-ring" text="quotient ring" */>}} $R/\ker\varphi$. This is the key input for {{</* knowl id="first-isomorphism-theorem-rings" text="the First Isomorphism Theorem for rings" */>}}.
