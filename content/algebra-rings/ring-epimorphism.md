A **ring epimorphism** is a {{</* knowl id="ring-homomorphism" text="ring homomorphism" */>}} $\varphi:R\to S$ that is {{</* knowl id="surjective-function" text="surjective" */>}} as a function.

Epimorphisms present $S$ as a quotient of $R$; the basic example is the natural projection onto a {{</* knowl id="quotient-ring" text="quotient ring" */>}}. They are the appropriate maps for “presenting” rings by generators and relations.

**Examples:**
- The quotient map $R\to R/I$, $r\mapsto r+I$, is a ring epimorphism.
- The evaluation map $k[x]\to k$, $f\mapsto f(c)$, is surjective for any field $k$ and $c\in k$.
- The inclusion $\mathbb Z\hookrightarrow \mathbb Q$ is not an epimorphism (not surjective).
