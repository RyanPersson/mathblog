Let $R$ be a ring. An element $e\in R$ is **idempotent** if $e^2=e$.

Idempotents are the algebraic shadows of direct product decompositions: under suitable hypotheses, they produce ring splittings as in {{</* knowl id="idempotent-product-decomposition" text="idempotent product decompositions" */>}}. In many commutative settings, nontrivial idempotents correspond to disconnectedness of $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$.

**Examples:**
- In any unital ring, $0$ and $1$ are idempotent.
- In $M_2(k)$, the matrix $\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}$ is idempotent.
- In an integral domain, every idempotent is $0$ or $1$.
