**UFD implies GCDs exist**: Let $R$ be a UFD and let $a,b\in R$ be not both zero. Then there exists $d\in R$ such that (i) $d\mid a$ and $d\mid b$, and (ii) if $c\mid a$ and $c\mid b$ then $c\mid d$. Any two such $d$ differ by multiplication by a unit; one writes $d=\gcd(a,b)$.

In a {{</* knowl id="ufd" text="unique factorization domain" */>}}, write $a$ and $b$ as products of {{</* knowl id="prime-element" text="prime elements" */>}} and take the product of the common primes with minimal exponents to obtain a {{</* knowl id="gcd" text="greatest common divisor" */>}}. Uniqueness is up to {{</* knowl id="associated-elements" text="associates" */>}}, and in a UFD prime elements coincide with {{</* knowl id="irreducible-element" text="irreducible elements" */>}}.
