Given ideals $I,J$ in a {{</* knowl id="ring" text="ring" */>}} $R$, their **product** $IJ$ is the {{</* knowl id="ideal-generated" text="ideal generated" */>}} by the set $\{ij:i\in I,\ j\in J\}$. Equivalently, $IJ$ consists of all finite sums $\sum_{k=1}^n i_k j_k$ with $i_k\in I$ and $j_k\in J$.

One always has $IJ\subseteq I\cap J$ and $IJ\subseteq I$ and $IJ\subseteq J$; equality $IJ=I\cap J$ is a strong condition (e.g. it holds for comaximal ideals by the {{</* knowl id="chinese-remainder-theorem" text="Chinese remainder theorem" */>}} framework). In commutative algebra, products model multiplicative behavior of vanishing conditions.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb Z$, $(m)(n)=(mn)$.
- In $k[x]$, $(x)(x)=(x^2)$.
- In $k[x,y]$, $(x)(y)=(xy)\subseteq (x)\cap (y)$ (in fact equality holds here).
