description: "An ideal generated by a single element."

A **principal ideal** in a {{</* knowl id="commutative-ring" text="commutative ring" */>}} $R$ is an {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" */>}} of the form
\[
(a)=\{ra:r\in R\}
\]
for some $a\in R$, i.e. an instance of an {{</* knowl id="ideal-generated" text="ideal generated" */>}} by one element.

Principal ideals control divisibility and factorization in commutative algebra; rings in which every ideal is principal are {{</* knowl id="pid" text="PIDs" */>}}. In noncommutative rings one often distinguishes left-principal and right-principal ideals.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb Z$, $(6)=6\mathbb Z$ is principal.
- In $k[x,y]$, $(x)$ is a principal ideal.
- In $k[x,y]$, the ideal $(x,y)$ is not principal.
