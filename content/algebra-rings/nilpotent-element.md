description: "An element whose sufficiently high power is zero."

Let $R$ be a ring. An element $a\in R$ is **nilpotent** if there exists an integer $n\ge 1$ such that $a^n=0$.

Nilpotent elements generate {{</* knowl id="nil-ideal" text="nil ideals" */>}} and collectively form the {{</* knowl id="nilradical" text="nilradical" */>}} in the commutative case. They measure the failure of a ring to be reduced and play a central role in deformation and infinitesimal structure.

**Examples:**
- In $k[x]/(x^n)$, the class of $x$ is nilpotent.
- Any strictly upper triangular matrix is nilpotent.
- In an integral domain, the only nilpotent element is $0$.
