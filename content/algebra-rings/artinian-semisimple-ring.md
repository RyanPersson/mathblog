An **Artinian semisimple ring** is a ring $R$ that is {{</* knowl id="semisimple-ring" text="semisimple" */>}} and Artinian (i.e. it satisfies the descending chain condition on ideals, equivalently on left ideals).

By the {{</* knowl id="artin-wedderburn-theorem" text="Artin–Wedderburn theorem" */>}}, such rings are precisely finite direct products of {{</* knowl id="matrix-ring" text="matrix rings" */>}} over {{</* knowl id="division-ring" text="division rings" */>}}, and these rings are the basic building blocks for finite-length module categories.

**Examples:**
- $M_n(k)$ is Artinian semisimple for any field $k$.
- A finite product of fields, e.g. $\mathbb{Q}\times \mathbb{Q}\times \mathbb{F}_5$, is Artinian semisimple.
- An infinite product $\prod_{i\in \mathbb{N}} k$ (with $k$ a field) is not Artinian, hence not Artinian semisimple.
