**Artin–Wedderburn theorem**: A ring \(R\) is {{</* knowl id="artinian-semisimple-ring" text="semisimple Artinian" */>} if and only if there exist positive integers \(n_1,\dots,n_t\) and {{</* knowl id="division-ring" text="division rings" */>} \(D_1,\dots,D_t\) such that
\[
R \ \cong\ \prod_{i=1}^t M_{n_i}(D_i),
\]
where \(M_{n_i}(D_i)\) is the {{</* knowl id="matrix-ring" text="matrix ring" */>} of size \(n_i\) over \(D_i\). In particular, \(R\) is {{</* knowl id="simple-ring" text="simple" */>} Artinian if and only if \(R\cong M_n(D)\) for some division ring \(D\).

This is the structural classification underpinning {{</* knowl id="semisimple-ring" text="semisimple rings" */>} and explains why representation-theoretic decompositions are controlled by matrix blocks.

**Proof sketch**: Semisimplicity implies that the regular module \(R_R\) decomposes into a finite direct sum of simple modules; Artinian hypotheses ensure finiteness and allow lifting idempotents. One shows \(R\) is isomorphic to a product of endomorphism rings of simple modules, and each such endomorphism ring is a matrix ring over a division ring by Schur-type arguments. Conversely, finite products of matrix rings over division rings are semisimple and Artinian by explicit module decompositions.
