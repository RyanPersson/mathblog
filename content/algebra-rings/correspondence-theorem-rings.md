**Correspondence theorem (rings)**: Let \(R\) be a ring, let \(I\triangleleft R\) be an {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" */>}}, and let \(\pi:R\to R/I\) be the quotient map. Then the assignment
\[
J\ \longmapsto\ J/I
\]
is an inclusion-preserving bijection between ideals \(J\) of \(R\) with \(I\subseteq J\) and ideals of the {{</* knowl id="quotient-ring" text="quotient ring" */>}} \(R/I\). The inverse bijection sends an ideal \(K\triangleleft R/I\) to the {{</* knowl id="preimage" text="preimage" */>}} \(\pi^{-1}(K)\).

Under this correspondence, {{</* knowl id="prime-ideal" text="prime ideals" */>}} (and likewise {{</* knowl id="maximal-ideal" text="maximal ideals" */>}} in the commutative case) correspond to prime (respectively maximal) ideals containing \(I\).
