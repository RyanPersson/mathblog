**Hilbert basis theorem**: Let \(R\) be a {{</* knowl id="commutative-ring" text="commutative ring" */>}}. If \(R\) is Noetherian (i.e. every ascending chain of {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideals" */>} stabilizes), then the {{</* knowl id="polynomial-ring" text="polynomial ring" */>}} \(R[x]\) is Noetherian. More generally, \(R[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) is Noetherian for every \(n\ge 1\).

**Proof sketch**: Let \(I\triangleleft R[x]\). Consider the ideal \(J\subseteq R\) generated by leading coefficients of polynomials in \(I\). Noetherianness of \(R\) gives finite generators of \(J\), and one then uses a degree-reduction argument to show that finitely many polynomials in \(I\) generate all of \(I\).
