A **semisimple ring** is a unital ring $R$ such that every left $R$-module is semisimple (i.e. a direct sum of simple modules). Equivalently, the left regular module ${}_RR$ is a direct sum of minimal left ideals.

In structural terms, semisimple rings are exactly those described by the {{</* knowl id="artin-wedderburn-theorem" text="Artin–Wedderburn theorem" */>}}: they are finite products of {{</* knowl id="matrix-ring" text="matrix rings" */>}} over {{</* knowl id="division-ring" text="division rings" */>}}. A key obstruction to semisimplicity is the {{</* knowl id="jacobson-radical" text="Jacobson radical" */>}}, which vanishes for semisimple rings.

**Examples:**
- $M_n(k)$ is semisimple for any field $k$ and integer $n\ge 1$.
- $M_2(\mathbb{Q})\times \mathbb{Q}$ is semisimple.
- The ring $k[x]/(x^2)$ is not semisimple: the class of $x$ is nonzero but nilpotent, forcing a nontrivial Jacobson radical.
