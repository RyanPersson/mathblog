**Fields are exactly commutative division rings**: A ring \(R\) is a {{</* knowl id="field" text="field" */>}} if and only if it is a {{</* knowl id="division-ring" text="division ring" */>}} whose multiplication is commutative (equivalently, \(R\) is a {{</* knowl id="commutative-ring" text="commutative ring" */>}} in which every nonzero element is invertible).

This lemma packages the usual equivalence of “commutative + all nonzero invertible” with the field axioms used throughout algebra and algebraic geometry.
