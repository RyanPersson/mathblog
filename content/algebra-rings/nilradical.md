Let $R$ be a commutative ring. The **nilradical** of $R$ is the set
\[
\sqrt{(0)}=\{a\in R : a \text{ is nilpotent}\},
\]
i.e. the set of all {{</* knowl id="nilpotent-element" text="nilpotent elements" */>}} of $R$; it is an ideal (indeed, the radical of the zero ideal in the sense of {{</* knowl id="radical-of-ideal" text="radicals of ideals" */>}}).

The nilradical can also be characterized as the intersection of all {{</* knowl id="prime-ideal" text="prime ideals" */>}} (a standard fact recorded as {{</* knowl id="nilradical-intersection-primes" text="nilradical = intersection of primes" */>}}). A ring is reduced precisely when its nilradical is zero.

**Examples:**
- If $R$ is reduced, then its nilradical is $\{0\}$.
- In $k[x]/(x^n)$, the nilradical is the ideal generated by the class of $x$.
- In $\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$, the nilradical consists of classes divisible by every prime dividing $n$.
