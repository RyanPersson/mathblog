A **principal ideal domain (PID)** is an {{</* knowl id="integral-domain" text="integral domain" */>}} $R$ such that every {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" */>}} $I\subseteq R$ is {{</* knowl id="principal-ideal" text="principal" */>}}, i.e. $I=(a)$ for some $a\in R$.

PIDs provide strong control of divisibility and modules, and they sit between Euclidean domains and unique factorization: every {{</* knowl id="euclidean-domain" text="Euclidean domain" */>}} is a PID, and every PID is a {{</* knowl id="ufd" text="UFD" */>} (see {{</* knowl id="pid-implies-ufd" text="PID implies UFD" */>}).

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb{Z}$ is a PID.
- If $k$ is a field, then $k[x]$ is a PID (indeed Euclidean).
- $k[x,y]$ is not a PID since $(x,y)$ is not principal.
