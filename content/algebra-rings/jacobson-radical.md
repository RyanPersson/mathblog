title: "Jacobson radical"
description: "The intersection of all maximal ideals, equivalently the elements acting trivially on simple modules."

Let $R$ be a ring. The **Jacobson radical** $J(R)$ is the intersection of all {{</* knowl id="maximal-ideal" text="maximal ideals" */>}} of $R$ (in the commutative case), and more generally can be defined as the intersection of annihilators of all simple right $R$-modules.

In a unital ring, an element $a$ lies in $J(R)$ iff for every $r\in R$ the element $1-ar$ is a {{</* knowl id="unit" text="unit" */>}}. The Jacobson radical is always an {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" */>}}, and $R/J(R)$ captures the “semisimple part” of $R$.

**Examples:**
- For $R=\mathbb Z$, one has $J(R)=\{0\}$.
- For a local ring $(R,\mathfrak m)$, $J(R)=\mathfrak m$.
- For $R=\mathbb Z/p^k\mathbb Z$, $J(R)$ is the ideal generated by the class of $p$.
