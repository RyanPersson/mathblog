description: "The kernel of a ring homomorphism is always a two-sided ideal."

**Kernels are two-sided ideals**: If \(\varphi:R\to S\) is a {{</* knowl id="ring-homomorphism" text="ring homomorphism" */>}}, then its {{</* knowl id="kernel-ring" text="kernel" */>}} \(\ker(\varphi)\) is a {{</* knowl id="two-sided-ideal" text="two-sided ideal" */>} of \(R\).

This lemma is a prerequisite for forming the associated {{</* knowl id="quotient-ring" text="quotient ring" */>} \(R/\ker(\varphi)\) and is used immediately in the {{</* knowl id="first-isomorphism-theorem-rings" text="first isomorphism theorem for rings" */>}}.
