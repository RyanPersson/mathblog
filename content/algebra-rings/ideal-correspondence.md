**Ideal correspondence for quotients**: Let $R$ be a ring and let $I\lhd R$ be a two-sided ideal, with quotient map $\pi:R\to R/I$. The assignment
\[
J\longmapsto J/I
\]
is a bijection between two-sided ideals $J\lhd R$ with $I\subseteq J$ and two-sided ideals of $R/I$, with inverse $K\mapsto \pi^{-1}(K)$. This correspondence preserves inclusion and carries sums and intersections to sums and intersections.

This is the ring form of the {{</* knowl id="correspondence-theorem-rings" text="Correspondence Theorem" */>}} applied to the canonical {{</* knowl id="ring-epimorphism" text="epimorphism" */>}} $\pi$, and it explains how {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideals" */>}} in a {{</* knowl id="quotient-ring" text="quotient ring" */>}} lift and descend. In particular, {{</* knowl id="prime-ideal" text="prime ideals" */>}} and {{</* knowl id="maximal-ideal" text="maximal ideals" */>}} of $R/I$ correspond to those of $R$ that contain $I$ (in the commutative setting).
