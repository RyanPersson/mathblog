A **ring monomorphism** is a {{</* knowl id="ring-homomorphism" text="ring homomorphism" */>}} $\varphi:R\to S$ that is {{</* knowl id="injective-function" text="injective" */>}} as a function.

Monomorphisms identify $R$ with a subring of $S$ up to isomorphism; equivalently, they are the homomorphisms with trivial {{</* knowl id="kernel-ring" text="kernel" */>}}. In many contexts, one suppresses $\varphi$ and views $R$ as sitting inside $S$.

**Examples:**
- The inclusion $\mathbb Z\hookrightarrow \mathbb Q$ is a ring monomorphism.
- The map $k[x]\hookrightarrow k[x,y]$ sending $f(x)\mapsto f(x)$ is a ring monomorphism.
- The reduction map $\mathbb Z\to \mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$ is not a monomorphism for $n\ge 2$.
