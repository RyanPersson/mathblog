Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1$. The **formal power series ring** $R[[x]]$ consists of all infinite sums
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_i x^i \quad (a_i\in R),
\]
with addition defined coefficientwise and multiplication defined by the Cauchy product (so the coefficient of $x^n$ is $\sum_{i+j=n} a_i b_j$).

There is a natural inclusion of {{</* knowl id="polynomial-ring" text="polynomials" */>}} into $R[[x]]$ (finite series). If $R$ is a field, then $R[[x]]$ is a local ring with unique {{</* knowl id="maximal-ideal" text="maximal ideal" */>}} generated by $x$, and it is a fundamental example for completions and deformation arguments.

**Examples:**
- For a field $k$, $k[[x]]$ is a domain in which $x$ is nonzero but topologically “small”.
- In $\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$, the element $1+x$ is a unit with inverse $1-x+x^2-x^3+\cdots$.
- An expression with infinitely many negative powers of $x$ is not in $R[[x]]$.
