**Unique factorization theorem**: Let \(R\) be a {{</* knowl id="ufd" text="unique factorization domain" */>}}. Every nonzero element of \(R\) that is not a {{</* knowl id="unit" text="unit" */>}} can be written as a finite product of {{</* knowl id="irreducible-element" text="irreducible elements" */>}}. Moreover, if
\[
r = u\,p_1\cdots p_m = v\,q_1\cdots q_n
\]
with \(u,v\) units and \(p_i,q_j\) irreducible, then \(m=n\) and after reordering, each \(p_i\) is {{</* knowl id="associated-elements" text="associated" */>} to \(q_i\). In particular, irreducibles are {{</* knowl id="prime-element" text="prime" */>} in a UFD.

This theorem is the foundational reason gcd/lcm notions behave well in UFDs and underlies factorization results in polynomial rings via Gauss-type arguments.
