The **field axioms** say that a set \(F\) with operations \(+\) and \(\cdot\) satisfies:

1. \(F\) is a {{</* knowl id="commutative-ring" text="commutative ring" */>}}.
2. \(F\) satisfies the {{</* knowl id="unital-ring" text="unital ring" */>}} axiom with identity \(1\neq 0\).
3. Every \(a\in F\) with \(a\neq 0\) is a {{</* knowl id="unit" text="unit" */>}}.

Equivalently, the {{</* knowl id="group-of-units" text="group of units" */>}} is \(F\setminus\{0\}\). A structure satisfying these axioms is precisely a {{</* knowl id="field" text="field" */>}}.
