description: "The smallest ideal containing a given subset, equivalently the set of finite ring combinations of its elements."

Given a {{</* knowl id="subset" text="subset" */>}} $A\subseteq R$ of a {{</* knowl id="ring" text="ring" */>}} $R$, the **ideal generated by $A$**, denoted $(A)$, is the smallest {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" */>}} of $R$ containing $A$. Equivalently, $(A)$ consists of all finite sums of the form
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n r_i a_i s_i
\]
with $n\ge 1$, $a_i\in A$, and $r_i,s_i\in R$ (in the commutative case, one may take $s_i=1$).

When $A=\{a\}$ is a singleton, $(A)$ is a {{</* knowl id="principal-ideal" text="principal ideal" */>}}. This construction is functorial in the sense that homomorphisms send generated ideals to generated ideals of images (up to containment).

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb Z$, the ideal generated by $\{6,10\}$ is $(2)$.
- In $k[x,y]$, the ideal generated by $\{x,y\}$ is $(x,y)$.
- In $M_2(k)$, the two-sided ideal generated by a nonzero matrix is all of $M_2(k)$.
