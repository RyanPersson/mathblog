A **two-sided ideal** of a {{</* knowl id="ring" text="ring" */>}} $R$ is an {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" */>}} $I\subseteq R$ such that $rI\subseteq I$ and $Ir\subseteq I$ for all $r\in R$.

Two-sided ideals are precisely the ideals for which the {{</* knowl id="quotient-ring" text="quotient ring" */>}} $R/I$ carries a well-defined multiplication induced from $R$. In commutative rings, every ideal is automatically two-sided.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb Z$, every ideal $n\mathbb Z$ is two-sided.
- In $M_n(k)$, the only two-sided ideals are $\{0\}$ and $M_n(k)$.
- In an upper triangular matrix ring, strictly upper triangular matrices form a two-sided ideal.
