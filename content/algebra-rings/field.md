description: "A commutative unital ring in which every nonzero element is invertible."

A **field** is a {{</* knowl id="commutative-ring" text="commutative ring" */>}} with $1\neq 0$ such that every nonzero element is a {{</* knowl id="unit" text="unit" */>}} (equivalently, every $a\neq 0$ has a multiplicative inverse).

Fields are precisely rings with only the “trivial” ideals: $R$ is a field iff its only {{</* knowl id="ideal" text="ideals" */>}} are $(0)$ and $R$, and iff $(0)$ is {{</* knowl id="maximal-ideal" text="maximal" */>}.

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are fields.
- For a prime $p$, $\mathbb{F}_p=\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is a field.
- $\mathbb{Z}$ is not a field since $2$ has no inverse in $\mathbb{Z}$.
