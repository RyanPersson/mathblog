title: "Linear Closure of a Convex Set is Convex"
description: "The set lin(Ω) is convex whenever Ω is convex."

Let $X$ be a {{< knowl id="vector-space" section="shared-linear-algebra" text="vector space" >}} and let $\Omega\subset X$ be {{< knowl id="convex-set" text="convex" >}}.

**Proposition**: The {{< knowl id="linear-closure" text="linear closure" >}} $\operatorname{lin}(\Omega)$ is convex.

**Context:**
The definition of $\operatorname{lin}(\Omega)$ is built from {{< knowl id="line-segments-in-a-vector-space" text="line segments" >}}. Convexity of $\Omega$ ensures that "segments staying in $\Omega$" is stable under {{< knowl id="convex-combination" text="convex combinations" >}}, which yields convexity of $\operatorname{lin}(\Omega)$.
