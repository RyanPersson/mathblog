description: "An affine set Ω is parallel to a subspace L if Ω=ω+L for some ω∈Ω."

Let $X$ be a {{< knowl id="vector-space" section="shared-linear-algebra" text="vector space" >}}. An {{< knowl id="affine-set" text="affine set" >}} $\Omega\subset X$ is said to be **parallel** to a {{< knowl id="linear-subspace" text="linear subspace" >}} $L\subset X$ if
$$
\Omega=\omega+L
$$
for some $\omega\in\Omega$.

By {{< knowl id="affine-sets-are-translates-of-subspaces" text="the translate characterization" >}}, every nonempty affine set is parallel to at least one subspace. The parallel subspace is unique and can be written explicitly as $\Omega-\Omega$; see {{< knowl id="parallel-subspace-to-an-affine-set-is" text="the Ω−Ω proposition" >}}.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}^n$, any affine subspace is parallel to its direction subspace (the translation of the affine set through the origin).
