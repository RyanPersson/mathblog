**Convexity Under Monotone Convex Composition**: Let $X$ be a {{< knowl id="vector-space" section="shared-linear-algebra" text="vector space" >}}. Suppose $f:X\to\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is {{< knowl id="convex-function-via-epigraph" text="convex" >}} and $\phi:\mathbb{R}\to\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is convex and nondecreasing on a convex set containing the range of $f$. Then the composition $\phi\circ f$ is convex on $X$.

This rule is a standard way to build convex penalties (e.g., $\phi(t)=e^t$ or $\phi(t)=t_+ := \max\{t,0\}$) from an existing convex function $f$.

**Proof sketch (idea):** Apply Jensen to $f$ to get $f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda)y)\le \lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda)f(y)$. Then use monotonicity of $\phi$ followed by Jensen for $\phi$.
