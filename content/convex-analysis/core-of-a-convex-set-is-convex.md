title: "Core of a Convex Set is Convex"
description: "Taking algebraic interior preserves convexity"
---

Let $X$ be a {{< knowl id="vector-space" section="shared-linear-algebra" text="vector space" >}} and let $\Omega\subset X$ be {{< knowl id="convex-set" text="convex" >}}, with $\operatorname{core}(\Omega)\neq\emptyset$.

**Proposition**: The set {{< knowl id="algebraic-interior-core" text="core(Ω)" >}} is convex.

**Context:** This is the algebraic analogue of the fact that the {{< knowl id="interior-of-a-set" text="interior" >}} of a convex set (in a normed space) is convex; compare {{< knowl id="interior-and-closure-of-a-convex-set-are-convex" text="interior/closure of convex sets" >}}.
